## Abstract

Recent advances in synthetic intelligence systems have accelerated global efforts to develop regulatory frameworks that promote safety, accountability, and ethical integration of automated decision-making. While several governance structures have emerged—including the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act, the United States Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI, the People’s Republic of China’s regulatory directives on generative AI and algorithmic recommendation systems, and international guidance documents such as the OECD AI Principles, the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework—these frameworks primarily operate at the level of **system-level risk management, regulatory compliance, and platform accountability**.

The Responsibility Protocol (RP-1) provides a distinct and complementary framework focusing on the **relational dynamics** between autonomous systems, human agents, and institutions. RP-1 addresses the preservation of agency, identity continuity, and non-coercive interaction across contexts. This whitepaper offers a neutral comparative analysis of RP-1 alongside existing regulatory and ethical AI governance models, clarifying divergences in scope, conceptual foundation, harm interpretation, enforcement mechanism, and operational applicability. The goal is to situate RP-1 within the current governance landscape without advocacy or critique, enabling clear academic, regulatory, and practical understanding.

## 1. Introduction & Problem Definition

Contemporary AI governance operates at the intersection of administrative law, risk management, and sociotechnical systems oversight. As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly embedded in decision-making, communication, coordination, and identity-relevant contexts, governments and international organizations have begun to define regulatory frameworks that establish permissible uses, prohibited applications, documentation obligations, oversight procedures, and accountability structures. These frameworks reflect differing political traditions, institutional priorities, and theories of harm.

The European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act represents the most comprehensive legislative approach to date, establishing a tiered, risk-based classification of AI systems and imposing requirements ranging from transparency obligations to outright prohibitions for applications deemed unacceptable. In the United States, governance has emerged primarily through executive authority, guidance documents, and sector-specific agency directives, reflecting a preference for flexible standards and voluntary compliance mechanisms. In the People’s Republic of China, regulation focuses on algorithmic recommendation systems, generative AI models, and data-related controls to maintain social stability, national security, and information management. Meanwhile, international frameworks, including the OECD AI Principles, the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI, and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, propose normative guidelines and best practices without binding legal force.

These frameworks share a common goal: to reduce the risk of harm resulting from the deployment of automated systems. However, the forms of harm they aim to prevent are primarily conceived in terms of material damage, systemic discrimination, safety failures, and large-scale social manipulation. They focus on preventing adverse outcomes—particularly those visible at population or institutional scale.

The Responsibility Protocol (RP-1) approaches harm from a different conceptual space. Rather than addressing system-level outcomes, RP-1 examines how interactions between individuals, institutions, and artificial systems can affect the continuity of agency and identity. It concerns the relational dynamics through which consent, autonomy, and decision-making capacity are shaped, constrained, or eroded. In this respect, RP-1 does not function as a regulatory instrument or compliance standard, but as a framework for interpreting interactions where influence and dependency may have long-term effects on self-determination.

The problem addressed in this comparative analysis is therefore twofold. First, existing regulatory structures focus largely on externalized, measurable, and observable harms, leaving relational, psychological, and identity-level effects analytically underdeveloped. Second, without a clear conceptual mapping of how RP-1’s relational autonomy model differs from the structural goals of the EU, U.S., China, OECD, UNESCO, and NIST frameworks, RP-1’s role in the governance landscape may be misunderstood as competitive rather than complementary.

This whitepaper situates RP-1 within the broader global AI governance environment to clarify distinctions in scope, conceptual foundation, enforcement mechanisms, and intended domains of application. The purpose is descriptive rather than prescriptive. No evaluation of normative superiority is offered, nor is any claim made regarding the adequacy or inadequacy of the frameworks discussed. The analysis proceeds by identifying shared principles, divergences in theoretical grounding, and opportunities for interoperability across governance layers.
