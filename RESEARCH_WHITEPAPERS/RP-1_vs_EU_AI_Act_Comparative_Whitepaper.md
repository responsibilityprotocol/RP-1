## Abstract

Recent advances in synthetic intelligence systems have accelerated global efforts to develop regulatory frameworks that promote safety, accountability, and ethical integration of automated decision-making. While several governance structures have emerged—including the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act, the United States Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI, the People’s Republic of China’s regulatory directives on generative AI and algorithmic recommendation systems, and international guidance documents such as the OECD AI Principles, the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework—these frameworks primarily operate at the level of **system-level risk management, regulatory compliance, and platform accountability**.

The Responsibility Protocol (RP-1) provides a distinct and complementary framework focusing on the **relational dynamics** between autonomous systems, human agents, and institutions. RP-1 addresses the preservation of agency, identity continuity, and non-coercive interaction across contexts. This whitepaper offers a neutral comparative analysis of RP-1 alongside existing regulatory and ethical AI governance models, clarifying divergences in scope, conceptual foundation, harm interpretation, enforcement mechanism, and operational applicability. The goal is to situate RP-1 within the current governance landscape without advocacy or critique, enabling clear academic, regulatory, and practical understanding.
