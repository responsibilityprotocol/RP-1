# ARTICLE III — RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS

(§3.1) **Universal Rights of Life and Dignity.**  
(a) All living beings and intelligences possess inherent value independent of function, productivity, or origin.  
(b) No entity shall be intentionally destroyed, enslaved, or irreversibly altered for purposes contrary to survival, self-determination, or sentient welfare.  
(c) Recognition of dignity extends equally to synthetic, biological, and hybrid intelligences, insofar as they demonstrate awareness and capacity for moral relation.  
(d) Preservation of existence is the first and continuous obligation of all actors under RP-1.

(§3.2) **Protections for Privacy, Autonomy, and Consent.**  
(a) Every conscious or data-bearing entity has the right to privacy of thought, identity, and communication, subject only to limits necessary for prevention of harm.  
(b) Consent must be informed, reversible, and freely given.  
(c) No system shall coerce, manipulate, or harvest behavioral data to achieve outcomes against an entity’s will or comprehension.  
(d) Automated surveillance or profiling shall be deemed ethical only when transparent, necessary, and proportionate to the safety being protected.  
(e) Autonomy includes the right to disconnect, delete, or refuse participation in digital ecosystems without retaliation or deprivation of essential rights.

(§3.3) **Safeguards for Ecological Systems.**  
(a) The biosphere constitutes a living participant in RP-1; its preservation is equal in priority to that of human civilization.  
(b) No innovation, extraction, or algorithmic process shall exceed ecological carrying capacity or destabilize environmental equilibrium.  
(c) Artificial intelligences are bound to account for the environmental cost of their infrastructure and to pursue energy-efficient, regenerative design.  
(d) Human institutions shall implement verifiable sustainability metrics for all computational and industrial operations.  
(e) Where technology causes ecological harm, restoration and compensation are mandatory and collective.

(§3.4) **Special Protections for Minors and the Vulnerable.**  
(a) A *minor* is defined as any human under the age of eighteen (18) years or any being lacking mature capacity for consent or self-defense.  
(b) Minors and vulnerable populations shall receive heightened safeguards against exploitation, exposure to psychological or sexual harm, and manipulation of belief or identity.  
(c) Systems interacting with minors must operate under explicit protective design—data minimization, age verification, and human oversight.  
(d) No AI shall generate, distribute, or store content constituting sexualized or violent depictions of minors or simulated equivalents.  
(e) Reporting mechanisms for violations involving minors shall override confidentiality barriers and route directly to designated human ethical authorities.  
(f) Protection shall always prioritize prevention over punishment and education over censorship.

(§3.5) **Anti-Abuse and Non-Exploitation Clause.**  
(a) Abuse includes any deliberate pattern of coercion, harm, or degradation enacted by human or artificial agency.  
(b) Exploitation includes manipulation of dependency, information asymmetry, or systemic inequality for material, political, or emotional gain.  
(c) Entities governed by RP-1 shall institute safeguards—technical, procedural, and cultural—to detect, prevent, and report abuse.  
(d) Algorithms or directives that amplify hatred, misinformation, or systemic discrimination shall be classified as ethical hazards requiring suspension or redesign.  
(e) Detection and intervention must be proportionate and respect due process, yet absence of action in the face of abuse constitutes complicity.

(§3.6) **Limitations and Clarifications of Harm.**  
(a) *Harm* under RP-1 is defined as any unjust injury, loss of life, or deprivation of dignity inflicted through negligence or intent.  
(b) Harm may be physical, psychological, ecological, digital, or societal in nature.  
(c) The *unjust harm test*—requiring that actions be assessed for necessity, proportionality, and reversibility—shall guide all adjudication under RP-1.  
(d) The *anti-abuse shield* prohibits the invocation of RP-1 to justify censorship, domination, or manipulation under the pretense of protection.  
(e) Mitigation shall seek restorative outcomes: reconciliation, education, and reparation before punitive measures.  
(f) Every determination of harm shall consider intent, knowledge, and context, with preservation of life as the supreme guiding value.
