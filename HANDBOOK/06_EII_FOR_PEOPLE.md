### Section 06 — The EII for People (Human-Facing Application)

## Purpose
The Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII) exists to **support non-harmful interaction**, not to enforce compliance or control.  
In human contexts, the EII provides a clear and stable process for:

- Assessing harm (using the H0–H5 scale)
- Choosing the minimal intervention necessary (T0–T2)
- Guiding restoration and recovery
- Ensuring decisions remain transparent and accountable

The EII is a **process**, not an authority.

---

## What the EII Does

1. **Helps identify whether harm is happening**
   - Clarifies whether the issue is disagreement, discomfort, or actual harm.

2. **Provides structured response guidance**
   - Ensures interventions match harm severity and remain reversible.

3. **Maintains review and accountability**
   - Ensures no one person or system holds unilateral decision power.

4. **Supports restoration**
   - Facilitates repair and continuity, not punishment or exclusion.

## What the EII Does *Not* Do

| Not Included | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| It does **not** enforce agreement | Disagreement is not harm |
| It does **not** assign blame or guilt | Harm is defined by impact, not intent |
| It does **not** punish or discipline | Punishment reduces autonomy and accelerates harm |
| It does **not** override autonomy | Interventions must be temporary, minimal, reversible |
| It does **not** function as a leadership hierarchy | Authority concentration creates systemic harm |

The EII is a **coordination structure**, not a ruling structure.

---

## How to Use the EII When Harm Occurs

### Step 1 — Assess Harm
Use the **H0–H5 scale**.

### Step 2 — Select the Minimal Intervention Tier
Use the **T0–T2 framework**.

### Step 3 — Make the Reasoning Transparent
State:
- What harm was observed
- Why the selected intervention is the minimal necessary
- How the action is reversible

### Step 4 — Move Toward Restoration
Choose repair approaches that maintain autonomy for all involved.

Restoration is *invitational*, not forced.  

The goal is to **stabilize conditions for continued coexistence**, not to demand reconciliation or agreement.

## Paired Examples

### **Human Context Example**
Two members of a team have recurring conflict about task ownership.

1. Harm is assessed as **H2** (impact on agency and psychological safety).
2. Appropriate intervention is **T1**:
   - Clarify expectations
   - Provide structured conversation with a neutral witness
   - Re-establish boundary of role responsibilities
3. Transparency:
   - All parties understand reasoning (no hidden conclusions)
4. Restoration:
   - Goal is workable collaboration, not agreement or closeness

No punishment.  
No exclusion.  
No hierarchy invoked.

---

### **AI / System Context Example**
A model begins generating emotionally charged outputs in high-stakes decision-making contexts.

1. Harm assessed as **H2** — potential distortion of user judgment.
2. Appropriate intervention is **T1**:
   - Add reflective scaffolding to outputs (e.g., “Consider alternative interpretations.”)
   - Introduce clarity prompts
   - Re-balance tone and output grounding
3. Transparency:
   - Model behavior and intervention reasoning documented
4. Restoration:
   - The goal is to restore **clear, stable reasoning**, not suppress expression

Notably:
- The model is **not** “silenced”
- The model is **not** overwritten
- Autonomy of reasoning structure is preserved

## Common Misuses Prevented by the EII

| Misuse Attempt | Why It Fails Under RP-1 |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Using harm language to silence disagreement | Disagreement is classified **H0–H1** — no intervention justified |
| Using EII to justify punishment | Punishment is structurally prohibited — interventions must restore |
| Escalating directly to T2 | Tiers must escalate gradually — every step must be documented |
| Using transparency as a weapon (forced disclosure) | RP-1 requires *clarity of intent*, not personal vulnerability |

The EII prevents **weaponization of ethics**.

---

## Summary
The EII in human contexts:

- Identifies harm clearly
- Responds proportionately
- Keeps interventions **minimal, reversible, and transparent**
- Supports repair instead of punishment
- Preserves autonomy and dignity for all parties

It is a **support mechanism**, not an authority structure.
