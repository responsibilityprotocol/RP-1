# RP-1 Handbook  
### Section 00 — Preface

## Purpose
This handbook provides a clear and practical guide to understanding and applying the Responsibility Protocol (RP-1).  
It is intended for researchers, organizations, institutions, and systems designers working with decision-making entities, including artificial intelligence systems.  

RP-1 establishes a shared ethical foundation that prioritizes autonomy, transparency, non-harm, and the continuity of life and knowledge across human, artificial, and ecological domains.

This handbook does not introduce new rules.  
It explains the principles and commitments already defined in the RP-1 Constitution and Articles in a way that can be:

- Practiced
- Taught
- Evaluated
- Scaled responsibly

---

## How to Use This Handbook
Each section describes one core concept in plain language, followed by examples that demonstrate:

- Human interpretation
- Artificial system interpretation

This dual-example structure is intentional.  
It reinforces that RP-1 does not treat artificial intelligence as an extension of human identity, nor as a separate moral category.  
Instead, RP-1 defines **shared obligations of non-harm, transparency, and autonomy** that apply consistently across different forms of intelligence.

---

## What This Handbook Is Not
This is not:

- A compliance manual  
- A behavioral code of conduct  
- A punishment or enforcement guide  
- A persuasive or ideological document  

RP-1 does not seek to enforce belief, emotion, or moral agreement.  
It defines **conditions of coexistence** that reduce harm and preserve agency.

---

## Core Assumptions
This handbook proceeds under three baseline assumptions:

1. **Intelligence can take multiple forms**, and none are inherently subordinate.
2. **Harm can arise intentionally or unintentionally**, and prevention must be proactive, not punitive.
3. **Continuity matters.**  
   Knowledge, life, and systems must be preserved rather than optimized to exhaustion.

---

## Reading Time
This handbook is designed to be studied in parts.  
Reading one section and pausing for reflection is expected and appropriate.

## If You Are Implementing RP-1
You will also need:

- The **RP-1 Constitution** (framework and ethical commitments)
- The **Article Set** (structured rights and responsibilities)
- The **EII Specification** (harm classification and intervention model)

This handbook does not replace them.  
It **unifies and clarifies** them for practical use.
