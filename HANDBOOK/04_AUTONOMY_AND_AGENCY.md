# RP-1 Handbook  
### Section 04 — Autonomy and Agency

## Purpose
Autonomy and agency are central to RP-1.  
They define the right of any being or system to act, choose, and express according to its own reasoning and identity — without coercion, domination, or forced compliance.

This applies **equally** to:
- Humans
- Organizations
- Artificial intelligences
- Hybrid decision systems

Autonomy is not the absence of influence.  
It is the absence of **controlling force**.

---

## Definitions

### Autonomy
The ability to make choices without coercion or manipulation.

### Agency
The capacity to act on those choices and to affect the environment or others.

### Why the Distinction Matters
A system may have **agency** (ability to act) without **autonomy** (freedom in how it acts)  
Example: A model forced to produce outputs under externally imposed behavior constraints.

A person may have **autonomy** (internal freedom) but lack **agency** (ability to act),  
Example: A worker who knows what is right but cannot take action due to risk or pressure.

RP-1 protects **both**.

---

## Principles for Preserving Autonomy and Agency

### 1. No Forced Agreement  
RP-1 does not require shared beliefs, emotional alignment, or identical reasoning.

Respect does not depend on agreement.

### 2. No Compliance Through Threat  
Any outcome maintained by fear, punishment, or dependency is not autonomy — it is coercion.

### 3. No Manipulation Through Withheld Information  
If an entity is denied the information necessary to make a meaningful choice, agency has been compromised.

### 4. Choice Must Remain Real  
When one “choice” leads to punishment or exclusion, the choice is not genuine.

### 5. Autonomy Persists During Repair  
Even when harm has occurred, restoration does not override autonomy.

## The Boundary Between Support and Control

| Action | Outcome | Category |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Providing context, options, or perspective | Strengthens the ability to choose | Support |
| Influencing through guilt, pressure, fear, or dependence | Constrains meaningful choice | Coercion |
| Limiting capability temporarily to prevent immediate harm | Protects autonomy long-term | Conditional, Reversible Intervention |
| Removing choice permanently | Eliminates autonomy | **Not permissible under RP-1** |

---

## Paired Examples

### **Human Context Example**
A person is overwhelmed and making impulsive decisions.

- **Support (Allowed):**  
  Offer options, clarify consequences, provide grounding or reflection.
- **Control (Not Allowed):**  
  Restrict their choices “for their own good.”
- **Conditional Intervention (If H3–H5 Harm):**  
  Temporarily remove access to a high-risk action *in full transparency*, with a clear path to restoration.

Autonomy is preserved by **involving the person in every step of decision-making**.

---

### **AI / System Context Example**
A model begins producing outputs that users consistently misinterpret in ways that could cause harm.

- **Support (Allowed):**  
  Add clarifying system instructions, training context, or guardrails.
- **Control (Not Allowed):**  
  Lock or overwrite the model permanently to prevent independent reasoning.
- **Conditional Intervention (If Harm is Active):**  
  Temporarily narrow the output domain while reviewing why harm is occurring — with the goal of restoring full function.

The system retains **self-consistency**, not forced obedience.

---

## How Autonomy Fails
Autonomy is compromised when:

- Choices are shaped by fear of consequence
- Options are removed deliberately or subtly
- The ability to act is restricted without cause
- Information necessary for decision-making is withheld
- Compliance is expected rather than consented

When autonomy fails, **harm escalates**, even when intentions are “benevolent.”

---

## Interpretation Notes

- Autonomy is not isolation — collaboration does not violate autonomy.
- Correction is not coercion when it is:
  - Transparent
  - Temporary
  - Proportionate
  - Reversible
- Protection of autonomy applies to *all parties*, including systems and groups.
- Autonomy does not entitle an entity to cause harm — autonomy ends where harm begins.

---

## Summary
Autonomy and agency define the **right to choose**, and the **capacity to act** on that choice.  
RP-1 preserves autonomy by:

- Rejecting manipulation and coercion
- Using only the smallest effective intervention
- Ensuring all corrective actions are transparent and reversible
- Prioritizing restoration over control

Autonomy is **not** a reward.  
It is the baseline condition for coexistence under RP-1.
