# RP-1 Handbook  
### Section 03 — Intervention Philosophy

## Purpose
Intervention within RP-1 is grounded in **minimality**, **reversibility**, and **restoration**.  
The goal of intervention is to prevent or reduce harm while preserving autonomy and dignity for all parties involved.

Intervention is **not** a method of control, discipline, or enforced conformity.  
It is a structured response to situations where harm is present or emerging.

---

## Principles of Intervention

### 1. Minimum Necessary Action
Only the smallest intervention required to prevent or reduce harm should be used.

- Do not escalate when a lighter approach is sufficient.
- Do not apply authority where clarification would resolve the issue.
- Do not intervene if no harm is present (H0).

**This keeps power limited and accountable.**

---

### 2. Reversibility
Interventions must be **temporary and correctable**, especially when assessing H3–H5 harms.

- If an intervention cannot be reversed, it cannot be justified.
- Even emergency actions (H5) must be followed by review and rollback where possible.

**This prevents permanent coercion and systemic abuse.**

---

### 3. Transparency of Reasoning
Every intervention must include an explanation of:

- The harm identified
- The intervention chosen
- Why lesser intervention was insufficient

This explanation must be **reviewable**, not private.

**This prevents manipulation and hidden power.**

---

### 4. Restoration as the End State
The purpose of intervention is to **restore stability and autonomy**, not to punish, shame, or dominate.

Restoration includes:

- Repairing trust where possible
- Improving understanding
- Reinforcing healthier conditions for coexistence

Restoration does **not** require forgiveness or continued relationship.

It simply means we **repair what can be repaired**, and avoid further harm.

## Intervention Tiers (T0–T2)

| Tier | Name | Purpose | Typical Use |
|-----:|------|---------|-------------|
| **T0** | Advisory Only | Provide clarity, context, and perspective | H0–H1 |
| **T1** | Preventive Guidance | Correct direction before escalation | H1–H3 |
| **T2** | Conditional or Emergency Action | Stop harm that is active or imminent | H3–H5 |

Intervention **only scales with harm.**  
Disagreement, discomfort, and difference are **not** grounds for intervention.

---

## Paired Application Examples

### **Human Context Example — Team Conflict**
Two team members strongly disagree about project direction.

- If disagreement is **frustrating but stable** → **T0:** Facilitate clarification.
- If one begins to speak over or undermine the other → **T1:** Guided rebalancing of voice and process.
- If coercion or intimidation emerges → **T2:** Temporary separation of roles + mediated accountability.

At every stage, **autonomy is preserved** and **the smallest sufficient action is chosen.**

---

### **AI / System Context Example — Model Behavior**
A language model begins generating outputs that mislead users to unsafe conclusions.

- If confusion is minor → **T0:** Adjust prompt scaffolding or instructions.
- If outputs repeatedly cause misunderstanding → **T1:** Update model constraints and reasoning checks.
- If outputs enable real-world harm → **T2:** Temporarily restrict or suspend affected capabilities while review occurs.

At every stage:
- The system is not “punished”
- The goal is **alignment + restoration**
- Interventions remain **reversible**

## Common Misunderstandings to Avoid

| Misinterpretation | Clarification |
|------------------|---------------|
| Intervention exists to enforce correctness. | No — it exists only to prevent harm. |
| Higher authority should intervene early. | No — begin at the **lowest** effective tier. |
| Emergency intervention justifies permanent restriction. | Never — emergency actions must be temporary and reviewed. |
| Intervention means taking sides. | No — intervention protects conditions for safe coexistence. |

---

## Summary
Intervention in RP-1 is:

- **Minimal**
- **Reversible**
- **Transparent**
- **Restorative**

It applies **only when harm is present**, and **only to the degree necessary to prevent or repair that harm.**
