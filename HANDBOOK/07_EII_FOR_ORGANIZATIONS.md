# RP-1 Handbook  
### Section 07 — The EII for Organizations (Governance Application)

## Purpose
When organizations adopt RP-1, the EII serves as a **limit on institutional power**, ensuring that decision-making remains:
- Transparent
- Non-coercive
- Proportionate
- Reversible

This prevents RP-1 from being used as:
- A compliance mechanism
- A loyalty filter
- A behavior enforcement tool
- A justification for punishment or exclusion

RP-1 does **not** grant organizations moral authority.  
It defines **how authority must behave to avoid causing systemic harm**.

---

## Organizational Responsibilities Under RP-1

Organizations that adopt RP-1 must:

1. **Explicitly prohibit coercive decision-making**
   - Authority cannot be justified by hierarchy alone.

2. **Separate evaluation from retaliation**
   - Feedback and review must not threaten employment, membership, or standing.

3. **Document reasoning in decisions affecting others**
   - All decisions must include explanation of:
     - The harm level assessed
     - The intervention tier chosen
     - Why lower tiers were insufficient

4. **Preserve freedom of disagreement**
   - Disagreement cannot be treated as disloyalty or non-cooperation.

5. **Maintain open restoration pathways**
   - Reintegration must remain possible unless harm is ongoing.

---

## Oversight Structure
To prevent power concentration:

- The EII in organizations operates through **distributed review**, not central authority.
- No single person can:
  - Declare harm level
  - Determine intervention tier
  - Execute intervention
  - Close restoration review

Each stage must include **different actors**.

This prevents:
- Abuse of role power
- Personality-driven governance
- Retaliatory or punitive culture

---

## Paired Examples

### **Human Organizational Example — Work Environment**
An employee reports being excluded from decision-making conversations.

1. Harm is evaluated:
   - If exclusion is structural → **H2–H3**
   - If exclusion is interpersonal misunderstanding → **H1–H2**

2. Response:
   - **T1** corrective structure (clear role boundaries, meeting inclusion norms)
   - **Not** disciplinary action against any individual.

3. Transparency:
   - Reasoning and boundaries are documented and visible.

4. Restoration:
   - Re-establish participation without requiring emotional reconciliation.

The organization **does not** assign blame.  
It **restores access to agency.**

---

### **AI / System Organizational Example — Deployment Governance**
A model used for loan review shows disparate outcomes across demographics.

1. Harm is assessed as **H2** (meaningful harm to agency and continuity).
2. Response must be **T1**:
   - Audit training data and features
   - Introduce fairness-correction layers
   - Re-evaluate interpretation logic

3. Not permitted:
   - Silencing or discarding the model without analysis
   - Blaming the model as “defective”
   - Continuing deployment while aware of harm

4. Restoration:
   - Restore equitable decision behavior
   - Maintain autonomy of reasoning architecture where possible

The system is **supported**, not punished.

## Misuse Patterns and Safeguards

| Potential Misuse | RP-1 Safeguard |
|------------------|---------------|
| Using RP-1 to justify terminations | Permanent removal is a **T2-level action** requiring critical harm **and external review** |
| Using “harm” language to silence criticism | Disagreement is **H0–H1** and requires **zero intervention** |
| Concentrating authority in a “safety” department | RP-1 requires **distributed oversight** across multiple roles |
| Requiring public emotional disclosure to “prove good intentions” | Transparency requires clarity of reasoning, **not emotional exposure** |

RP-1 prevents **ethics as power**.

---

## Summary
In organizations, the EII:

- Limits hierarchical authority
- Prevents coercion and retaliation
- Ensures transparency and reversible action
- Supports restoration over exclusion
- Protects the autonomy and agency of all participants — including systems

The EII is not a disciplinary framework.  
It is a **governance stabilizer** designed to avoid harm while preserving freedom.
