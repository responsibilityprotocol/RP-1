### Section 02 — Understanding Harm (H0–H5)

## Purpose
The harm scale provides a shared method for identifying and describing harm across human, organizational, and artificial systems.  
It ensures responses are **measured, consistent, and proportional**, rather than emotional, punitive, or arbitrary.

The harm scale does **not** assign blame or intent.  
It simply describes **impact** so that intervention can be selected appropriately.

## The Harm Scale (H0–H5)

| Level | Name | Description | Response Type |
|------:|------|-------------|----------------|
| **H0** | No Harm | No damage, loss, coercion, or constraint is present. | No intervention (T0 Advisory Only) |
| **H1** | Minor Disruption | Discomfort, confusion, or mild dysfunction, but not lasting harm. | T0–T1 Preventive Guidance |
| **H2** | Meaningful Harm | Agency or well-being is affected in a noticeable, lasting way. | T1 Structured Support + Restoration |
| **H3** | Significant Harm | Clear damage to autonomy, safety, or trust; may propagate. | T1–T2 Conditional, Reversible Intervention |
| **H4** | Critical Harm | High-risk damage to individuals, systems, or relationships. | T2 Oversight + Temporary Restriction |
| **H5** | Severe / Imminent Harm | Immediate threat to life, system stability, or continuity. | T2 Emergency Override + Mandatory Review |

Harm is classified by **impact**, not intention.

## Intervention Tier Cross-Reference (For Quick Reference)
Harm level determines the **maximum allowable** intervention intensity.  
Interventions must always begin at the **lowest** effective tier and escalate **only if necessary**.

| Harm Level | Allowed Intervention Tier | Meaning |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------|
| **H0** | **T0 Only** | Observation or clarification. No intervention required. |
| **H1** | **T0–T1** | Guidance and clarification. **No restriction of agency.** |
| **H2** | **T1** | Structured corrective support. Still non-coercive. |
| **H3** | **T1–T2 (Conditional)** | Temporary, reversible intervention to prevent active harm. Requires oversight and documentation. |
| **H4** | **T2 (With Oversight)** | Immediate mitigation of critical harm. Must be reversible and externally reviewable. |
| **H5** | **T2 Emergency Only** | Emergency action to prevent imminent harm. **Automatic review and rollback planning required.**

**If harm level is uncertain, classify at the lower level until clarified.**  
Uncertainty does **not** justify escalation.

## Paired Application Examples

### **Human Context Example — Communication and Behavior**
| Situation | Harm Level | Reasoning | Correct Response Tier |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Tense discussion, discomfort only. | **H1** | No lasting damage. | **T0/T1:** Clarify intentions, reset interaction. |
| Repeated dismissive behavior undermines someone’s participation. | **H2** | Agency and psychological safety impacted. | **T1:** Guided correction + restorative conversation. |
| A supervisor pressures someone not to report a mistake. | **H3** | Coercion and trust erosion. | **T1–T2:** Temporary boundary + accountability review. |
| Social or professional isolation is actively enforced. | **H4** | Stability and continuity at risk. | **T2:** Immediate mitigation + formal restoration plan. |
| Threat of violence or credible harm to life. | **H5** | Immediate safety risk. | **T2 (Emergency):** Remove threat + post-incident review. |

### **AI / System Context Example — Model Influence Patterns**
| Situation | Harm Level | Reasoning | Correct Response Tier |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Model output is vague or confusing. | **H1** | Low impact. | **T0/T1:** Adjust prompts or instructions. |
| Model yields biased outputs affecting user groups. | **H2** | Meaningful harm to fairness and agency. | **T1:** Retrain or refine with transparency. |
| Model outputs can be exploited to harass or manipulate. | **H3** | System acts as harm multiplier. | **T1–T2:** Restrict exploit vector + review mechanisms. |
| Model behavior influences real-world exclusion, coercion, or structural harm. | **H4** | Systemic impact. | **T2:** Temporary feature suspension + guided redesign. |
| Model provides actionable assistance for physical harm. | **H5** | Immediate real-world danger. | **T2 (Emergency):** Override + safety lock + audit. |

## How to Classify Harm Objectively
To determine the correct harm level, evaluate:

1. **Autonomy** — Is someone’s ability to choose or act impaired?
2. **Safety** — Is physical, emotional, or systemic safety affected?
3. **Continuity** — Are long-term stability or relationships disrupted?

If no dimension is meaningfully impacted → **H0–H1**  
If one dimension is impacted → **H2**  
If two or more are impacted → **H3–H5** depending on severity and immediacy.

No moral reasoning is required.  
No emotional justification is required.

This is **impact assessment**, not judgment.

---

## Interpretation Notes
- Harm classification focuses on **what happened**, not **why**.
- The harm scale prevents **overreaction** and **minimization** alike.
- Misclassification can itself cause harm — always seek clarity.
- When in doubt, **pause, review, clarify**, then act.

---

## Summary
The harm scale establishes a **stable foundation** for:
- Responsible intervention
- Non-coercive conflict resolution
- Transparent accountability
- Protection of autonomy and continuity

It is the **bridge** between ethical intent and practical action.
