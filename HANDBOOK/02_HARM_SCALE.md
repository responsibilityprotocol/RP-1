# RP-1 Handbook  
### Section 02 — Understanding Harm (H0–H5)

## Purpose
The harm scale provides a shared way to recognize and describe harm across human, organizational, and artificial contexts.  
It allows us to respond appropriately without exaggeration, denial, or moral interpretation.

The harm scale does not assign blame.  
It guides **response level, intervention intensity, and restoration pathways.**

## The Harm Scale (H0–H5)

| Level | Name | Description | Response Type |
|------:|------|-------------|----------------|
| **H0** | No Harm | No damage, loss, coercion, or constraint is present. | No intervention (T0 Advisory Only) |
| **H1** | Minor Disruption | Discomfort, confusion, or mild dysfunction, but not lasting harm. | T1 Preventive Guidance |
| **H2** | Meaningful Harm | Agency, stability, or wellbeing is affected in a noticeable, lasting way. | T1 Preventive + Restorative Support |
| **H3** | Significant Harm | Clear damage to autonomy, safety, or trust; may spread beyond initial context. | T1/T2 Conditional Intervention + Due Process |
| **H4** | Critical Harm | High-risk damage to individuals, systems, or relationships; requires immediate mitigation. | T2 Conditional, Reversible Intervention + Review |
| **H5** | Severe / Imminent Harm | Immediate threat to life, system integrity, or continuity. | T2 Emergency Override (Temporary) + Mandatory Review |

---

## The Distinction That Matters Most

- **H1–H2 harms** are addressed through **education, redirection, and restoration**.
- **H3–H4 harms** require **intervention that is visible, accountable, and reversible**.
- **H5 harm** allows **temporary emergency action**, followed by **mandatory review and correction**.

No harm level **ever justifies permanent control or domination.  
All interventions are temporary and reviewable.**

## Paired Application Examples

### **Human Context Example — Workplace Communication**
| Observation | Harm Level | Reasoning | Response |
|------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Two people misunderstand each other in a meeting. | **H1** | Friction but no lasting damage. | Clarify intentions, reset expectations. |
| One person repeatedly interrupts and undermines another. | **H2** | Agency + psychological safety affected. | Guided correction + mediated conversation. |
| A supervisor threatens retaliation for disagreement. | **H3** | Coercion of autonomy and expression. | Structured accountability + oversight. |
| A pattern of intimidation isolates or damages someone's stability. | **H4** | Well-being and access to work/agency compromised. | Temporary intervention + restoration plan. |
| A credible threat to physical safety is present. | **H5** | Immediate danger. | Emergency removal from situation + post-review. |

---

### **AI / System Context Example — Model Behavior**
| Observation | Harm Level | Reasoning | Response |
|------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Model provides vague or incomplete output. | **H1** | Low-impact disruption. | Improve prompt framing / clarify inputs. |
| Model systematically fails for a demographic group. | **H2** | Meaningful inequity in outcomes. | Retraining + correction with transparency. |
| Model patterns can be exploited to harass users. | **H3** | Clear pathway to harm mediated through system action. | Restriction of exploit vectors + review. |
| Model outputs lead to real-world exclusion or coercion. | **H4** | Systemic harm with social or structural impact. | Safety override + mitigation + transparency report. |
| Model provides instructions to cause physical harm. | **H5** | Immediate real-world threat. | Emergency block + incident review + corrective redesign. |

## How to Identify Harm Without Moral Judgment
To classify harm correctly, ask:

1. **Is autonomy affected?**
2. **Is safety affected?**
3. **Is continuity (long-term wellbeing) affected?**

If the answer is *no* → H0  
If the answer is *yes* → scale rises based on **severity + duration + scope**

No moral framing is required.  
No emotional justification is required.

This is **assessment, not accusation.**

---

## Interpretation Notes
- Harm level does not imply intent.
- Harm classification focuses on **impact**, not blame.
- Misclassification of harm can itself cause harm — always seek clarity first.
- If uncertain between two levels, choose the **lower** until evidence clarifies.

---

## Summary
The harm scale is the foundation for:

- Choosing the **smallest effective intervention**
- Preventing overreach and unnecessary control
- Ensuring restoration is prioritized over punishment
- Aligning decisions between humans and artificial systems

Once harm is recognized clearly, intervention becomes **measured, accountable, and reversible**.
