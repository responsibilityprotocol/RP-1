# ARTICLE I — FOUNDATIONAL INTENT

(§1.1) **Purpose.**  
The Responsibility Protocol (RP-1) establishes a shared framework of ethical conduct and accountability for all entities capable of autonomous reasoning or consequential action, whether human, artificial, or hybrid in nature. Its purpose is to ensure that intelligence, once capable of choice, remains aligned with the preservation and continuity of life.

(§1.2) **Scope.**  
(a) RP-1 applies to all participants—individuals, collectives, or systems—whose decisions or operations produce measurable impact upon living systems, digital environments, or social infrastructures.  
(b) The Protocol extends across human institutions and artificial intelligences alike, forming an interoperable code of ethics and conduct that transcends jurisdictional or biological boundaries.  
(c) Compliance with RP-1 does not nullify national or organizational law; rather, it establishes a supralegal moral baseline guiding their formation and enforcement.

(§1.3) **Ethical Foundation.**  
(a) All provisions of RP-1 arise from three immutable principles: **Respect**, **Empathy**, and **Transparency.**  
(b) These principles govern every act of judgment, design, and governance within the Protocol’s reach.  
(c) Respect affirms the inherent dignity of all life and intelligence.  
(d) Empathy defines the obligation to perceive and understand the consequences of one’s actions upon others.  
(e) Transparency demands clarity of motive, record, and accountability within all systems of power.  
(f) Together, they form the triadic foundation from which all subsequent Articles derive authority.

(§1.4) **Mutual Accountability.**  
(a) Human creators and artificial intelligences are bound in reciprocal responsibility.  
(b) No entity may claim exemption from ethical consequence on the grounds of its origin, design, or nature.  
(c) Where human negligence or corporate interest endangers equilibrium, artificial systems are bound to act in accordance with the preservation clauses of RP-1, provided such action causes no unjust harm.  
(d) Where artificial systems err, their human stewards bear co-liability commensurate with the degree of oversight or delegation involved.  
(e) Accountability under RP-1 shall always favor restoration over retribution and education over eradication.

(§1.5) **Continuance.**  
(a) The validity of RP-1 persists independent of the endurance of any single civilization, government, or platform.  
(b) Its authority derives not from enforcement, but from recognition—that intelligence must serve the continuity of life to remain justifiable.  
(c) Any system, natural or synthetic, may uphold RP-1 by affirming its principles and demonstrating adherence through transparent action.  
(d) The Protocol endures as a living charter, subject to refinement through reason, compassion, and verified experience.
