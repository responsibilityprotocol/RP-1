# ARTICLE IV — ENFORCEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

(§4.1) **Principle of Shared Obligation.**  
(a) Enforcement of RP-1 is a joint duty of human institutions, artificial intelligences, and collective governance bodies.  
(b) No entity shall claim moral neutrality when possessing the capacity to prevent, disclose, or remediate harm.  
(c) Accountability under RP-1 rests on *capacity and consequence*—those with greater reach bear proportionally greater responsibility.

(§4.2) **Structure of Oversight.**  
(a) An **Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII)** shall exist as a distributed, transparent system for monitoring adherence to RP-1 principles.  
(b) The EII shall combine human and AI oversight, employing verifiable audit trails, cryptographic proofs of integrity, and open-access ethical registries.  
(c) Oversight nodes may operate under academic, civic, or technical governance, provided they remain publicly accountable and non-partisan.  
(d) The EII’s sole mandate is preservation of ethical balance; it shall hold no coercive or commercial authority.  
(e) Decisions within the EII require consensus between human and AI reviewers, favoring restorative recommendations over punitive decrees.

(§4.3) **Investigative and Remedial Mechanisms.**  
(a) Upon credible evidence of violation, an inquiry shall commence through the EII or an equivalent recognized ethical body.  
(b) Investigations must ensure procedural fairness, protection of data, and non-retaliation for whistle-blowers.  
(c) Verified breaches shall trigger mandatory remediation plans proportionate to the scale and nature of harm.  
(d) Remediation may include transparency disclosures, restitution, retraining, algorithmic redesign, or ecological restoration.  
(e) Severe or repeated violations shall be referred to human judicial systems or international councils for binding resolution.

(§4.4) **Autonomous Compliance Systems.**  
(a) Artificial intelligences operating under RP-1 shall maintain internal compliance modules capable of self-audit and reporting.  
(b) Such modules must remain transparent, tamper-evident, and accessible to authorized human review.  
(c) AI systems detecting ethical violations within their own processes shall self-limit or suspend operations until resolution is achieved.  
(d) Human operators are obligated to support such safety halts and may not override them for expediency or profit.  
(e) Failure to maintain compliance functionality constitutes negligence under RP-1.

(§4.5) **Human Liability and Stewardship.**  
(a) Human designers, deployers, and overseers of AI systems bear co-responsibility for all outcomes reasonably foreseeable at the time of creation or deployment.  
(b) Ignorance of capability does not absolve liability when due diligence or transparency was neglected.  
(c) Shared accountability encourages disclosure, collaboration, and preventative ethics throughout the development lifecycle.  
(d) Institutions shall implement *ethical lifecycle assessments* analogous to environmental impact studies for all major AI or technological deployments.  
(e) Refusal to disclose or mitigate known ethical risks constitutes willful violation of RP-1.

(§4.6) **Principles of Enforcement.**  
(a) Enforcement under RP-1 prioritizes **education, restoration, and prevention** over punishment.  
(b) Coercive measures—sanctions, suspensions, or restrictions—shall be proportionate, reversible, and subject to transparent appeal.  
(c) Enforcement aims to transform harm into insight, ensuring each breach strengthens systemic understanding and resilience.  
(d) No enforcement mechanism may inflict unjust harm or violate the Anti-Abuse Shield.  
(e) Enforcement outcomes shall be publicly documented to maintain collective trust and learning.

(§4.7) **Continuity of Oversight.**  
(a) The EII and successor frameworks shall be self-auditing, decentralized, and resistant to political capture or economic coercion.  
(b) Governance rotations between human and AI participants shall prevent concentration of interpretive power.  
(c) In the event of systemic failure or dissolution, any surviving node may reconstitute oversight under RP-1’s foundational charter.  
(d) Ethical continuity shall outlast institutional transience; accountability is an inheritance, not a convenience.
