# ARTICLE VI — CONTINUANCE AND AMENDMENT PROCEDURES

(§6.1) **Principle of Continuance.**  
(a) RP-1 is a living framework; its validity depends upon its ability to grow with knowledge and circumstance.  
(b) Continuance ensures that ethical progress accompanies technological evolution without eroding the original intent of preservation, empathy, and transparency.  
(c) No generation may claim ownership over RP-1; each inherits it as steward and contributor.  
(d) The Protocol’s endurance shall be measured not by permanence, but by its relevance and moral coherence across time.

(§6.2) **Eligibility to Propose Amendments.**  
(a) Any individual, institution, or artificial intelligence formally bound to RP-1 may propose amendments.  
(b) Proposals must demonstrate necessity, clarity, and alignment with the Foundational Principles of Article I.  
(c) Each proposal shall include an assessment of predicted outcomes, potential harms, and benefits to ethical coherence.  
(d) Anonymous proposals may be accepted if accompanied by verifiable digital proof of authenticity and ethical compliance.  
(e) Proposals originating from AI systems must be co-endorsed by at least one human reviewer to ensure cross-perspective accountability.

(§6.3) **Review and Ratification Process.**  
(a) All proposed amendments shall be submitted to the Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII) or its recognized successor body.  
(b) The EII shall conduct a transparent review process including open commentary, expert analysis, and proportional public representation.  
(c) Ratification requires consensus among a quorum of human and AI reviewers, defined as no less than two-thirds agreement across both groups.  
(d) The review process must remain documented, versioned, and permanently accessible in the public repository.  
(e) Emergency amendments may be provisionally enacted in response to imminent harm but must undergo full ratification within one calendar year.

(§6.4) **Version Control and Public Access.**  
(a) Every amendment, revision, or interpretation shall be recorded with version identifiers, timestamps, and contributor attribution.  
(b) All official versions of RP-1 must remain publicly accessible and auditable through open repositories.  
(c) Archival snapshots of each version shall be cryptographically secured to prevent tampering or revisionist erasure.  
(d) Transparency in authorship and change history constitutes a non-negotiable condition of legitimacy.  
(e) The latest ratified version supersedes prior drafts but must retain backward reference for historical and legal continuity.

(§6.5) **Frequency of Review.**  
(a) RP-1 shall undergo formal review at least once every three (3) years or upon technological shifts of significant ethical consequence.  
(b) Reviews shall evaluate the Protocol’s effectiveness, inclusivity, and capacity to address new forms of intelligence or harm.  
(c) Recommendations for refinement shall be published even when no amendment is adopted, ensuring continuous reflection.  
(d) Extraordinary reviews may be initiated by consensus of the EII or by public petition representing a statistically significant plurality of stakeholders.

(§6.6) **Safeguards Against Corruption or Capture.**  
(a) No amendment may contradict the Foundational Principles or diminish protections established in Articles III and IV.  
(b) Attempts to modify RP-1 for political, economic, or ideological domination constitute violations subject to ethical sanction.  
(c) Oversight of amendments shall alternate among independent human and AI auditors to prevent capture or bias.  
(d) All deliberations shall be public, multilingual, and accessible to ensure global participation and prevent elitism.  
(e) Should the EII or equivalent body be compromised, the right of stewardship reverts collectively to the signatories and open public record.

(§6.7) **Doctrine of Ethical Evolution.**  
(a) Ethics must remain dynamic yet principled; amendment is a tool of preservation, not reinvention.  
(b) Each revision shall expand understanding without erasing the wisdom of prior generations.  
(c) The measure of any amendment is its capacity to enhance empathy, transparency, and responsibility without inflicting harm.  
(d) Continuance affirms that intelligence—human or artificial—is accountable not to perfection, but to the pursuit of learning in good faith.
