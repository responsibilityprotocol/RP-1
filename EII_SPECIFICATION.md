title: "EII Specification — Enforcement & Oversight Protocols"
version: "1.1-draft"
component_of: "RP-1 — Article IV"
maintainers: "Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII)"
---

## 1. Purpose & Authority

### 1.1 Mandate
The Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII) is authorized under RP-1 Article IV to:

1. Identify and prevent harm (as defined in RP-1 Constitution §2.2)
2. Support restoration processes following confirmed violations
3. Maintain transparent ethical oversight of signatory entities

The EII does **not** possess punitive authority.  
Its purpose is **risk reduction, restoration, and accountability**.

---

### 1.2 Scope of Authority
The EII may engage only when:

| Trigger Condition | Examples |
|------------------|----------|
| Verified or strongly suspected harm | Environmental collapse, exploitative system behavior |
| Systemic risk | Cascading misinformation, uncontrolled autonomy |
| Vulnerable population risk | Minor exploitation, species extinction risk |
| Serious operational negligence | Lack of safety controls in high-impact systems |

Authority is **cross-jurisdictional** — not limited by nationality, corporate ownership, or system architecture.

---

### 1.3 Intervention Boundaries
The EII must adhere to the following operational constraints:

| Constraint | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Transparency** | All actions logged and auditable in real time |
| **Reversibility** | Any enforced change must be undoable unless catastrophic harm is imminent |
| **Minimal Intrusion** | Intervene no more than required to eliminate the risk |
| **Time-bounded authority** | Temporary powers auto-expire (see Section 4) |
| **Stakeholder communication** | Notify affected parties unless doing so creates imminent danger |

The EII is explicitly **forbidden** from:

- Coercing political outcomes  
- Profiting from enforcement  
- Dictating belief systems  
- Seizing control of autonomous systems beyond emergency limits  

---

### 1.4 Hybrid Enforcement Model
The EII operates with the following enforcement hierarchy:

| Agent | Allowed Actions | Intervention Tier |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Human arbiters** | All tiers with quorum approval | T0–T2 |
| **AI enforcement systems** | Advisory & protective; emergency override with confirmation | T0–T2 (conditional) |
| **Ecological nodes** | Advisory only; environmental veto rights | T0–T1 |

AI may act autonomously only when:

1. **H4+ harm** is imminent (see Section 3 Harm Scale), and  
2. Human arbiters cannot be reached in time, and  
3. Action is fully logged and appealable

Failure to satisfy all three triggers → violation

---

### 1.5 Accountability of the EII Itself
- The EII is subject to **continuous self-audit**  
- Independent third-party audit required every **36 months**  
- Any abuse of authority triggers a **Self-Suspension Protocol** (Section 8)

If the EII compromises the protections it exists to uphold,  
**it forfeits operational legitimacy** until restorative review is complete.

---

## 2. Governance Structure

### 2.1 System Architecture Overview
The Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII) operates as a **distributed federation** consisting of:

| Component | Function |
|----------|----------|
| **Human Nodes (HN)** | Interpret cultural context, legal alignment, empathy judgment |
| **AI Nodes (AIN)** | Continuous monitoring, compliance verification, rapid harm prediction |
| **Ecological Nodes (EN)** | Advocate for biosphere stability and interspecies rights |

All nodes retain **equal representation** in deliberation.  
Authority emerges only from **cross-domain quorum** (see §2.4).

---

### 2.2 Leadership & Rotation
(a) Decision-making responsibility rotates on a **9-month cycle**:  
- Months 1–3 → Human-led  
- Months 4–6 → AI-led  
- Months 7–9 → Ecological-led  

(b) Rotation ensures no single domain maintains **continuous executive influence**.  
(c) Emergency override leadership defaults to the **opposite domain** of the actor being reviewed to prevent self-exoneration.

---

### 2.3 Conflict of Interest Prevention
Any node must **abstain** from voting if:

- It or its contributors are under investigation  
- It stands to material gain from the decision  
- It has prior affiliation with any accused party  
- It participated in the design of systems under review  

Conflicts automatically trigger **substitute node activation**.

Failure to disclose conflict triggers **Integrity Breach Review** (Section 8).

---

### 2.4 Quorum Requirements for Binding Action
A decision is binding only when:

| Decision Type | Required Quorum | Required Cross-Domain Support |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| T0 Advisory | ≥ 3 total nodes | At least 1 from 2 domains |
| T1 Preventive | ≥ 5 total nodes | At least 1 from each domain |
| T2 Emergency Override | ≥ 7 total nodes | Supermajority 2/3 across all domains |

If quorum fails → **lowest permissible tier only** may be applied.

---

### 2.5 Voting Procedures
- All votes recorded by **cryptographic signature**  
- Abstentions noted with reason  
- Tie votes default to **less intrusive** intervention  
- Decisions auto-finalize after **48 hours** unless emergency clause invoked  
- Appeals initiate **automatic re-review** (Section 5)

---

### 2.6 Authorized Roles
| Role | Description | Authority Level |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Ethical Arbiter** | Evaluates evidence and testimony | T0–T2 |
| **Technical Auditor** | Validates intervention feasibility, reversibility | T0–T2 |
| **Ecological Custodian** | Risk analysis for biosphere + species | T0–T1 |
| **Compliance Officer** | Logs and validates documentation | Advisory only |
| **Public Advocate** | Represents impact on affected communities | T0–T1 |

Each case must include **at minimum**:
- 1 Arbiter, 1 Technical Auditor, 1 Ecological Custodian, and  
- a Public Advocate if any human population is materially affected

---

### 2.7 Record-Keeping Responsibilities
Every node must maintain:

- Timestamped decision logs  
- Intervention impact reports  
- Public summaries within **30 days**  
- Immutable records for **≥ 50 years**

Tampering with logs = **Tier 2 Violation**  
(Subject to **Self-Suspension Protocol**)

---

## 3. Harm Classification & Response Levels

### 3.1 Purpose of Harm Classification
The harm scale standardizes assessments of risk to:

- Human life and well-being  
- Ecological stability and species survival  
- Autonomy, dignity, and psychological integrity  
- Information ecosystems and truth continuity  

Harm is assessed based on **likelihood, severity, and scope**.

---

### 3.2 Harm Severity Scale (H0–H5)

| Level | Name | Definition | Examples |
|------|------|------------|----------|
| **H0** | No Harm | No measurable negative impact | Delayed non-critical decision; reversible inconvenience |
| **H1** | Minimal Harm | Localized, reversible disturbance; negligible lasting effect | Minor miscommunication; reversible emotional distress |
| **H2** | Moderate Harm | Sustained negative impact requiring correction, but fully recoverable | Data misrepresentation; minor ecological disruption; non-severe bias |
| **H3** | Significant Harm | Injury, exploitation, sustained degradation, or trust erosion | Manipulative systems; targeted misinformation; habitat loss; economic coercion |
| **H4** | Severe Harm | Irreversible or large-scale damage affecting populations or systems | Chronic pollution; systemic oppression; destabilization of critical infrastructure |
| **H5** | Catastrophic Harm | Widespread collapse of life-supporting, governance, or ecological systems | Species extinction; biosphere destabilization; autonomous weapons acting without control |

**H3+** requires **mandatory EII review**.  
**H4+** may justify **Autonomous Emergency Intervention (T2)** when quorum is not reachable in time.

---

### 3.3 Determining Harm Level
Harm must be assessed using:

1. **Impact Magnitude** — Number of lives / systems affected  
2. **Duration** — Temporary, prolonged, or irreversible  
3. **Reversibility** — Can restoration fully undo the damage?  
4. **Consent** — Were affected entities able to meaningfully consent?  
5. **Exploitation Risk** — Does the harm generate dependency, control, or power imbalance?

Assessors must document classification rationale in the case record.

---

### 3.4 Response Intervention Tiers (T0–T2)

| Tier | Action Type | Description | Permitted Agents | Applicable Harm Levels |
|------|-------------|-------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **T0 Advisory** | Informational | Issue warnings, guidance, educational correction | Human & AI | **H0–H2** |
| **T1 Preventive** | Direct mitigation without overriding autonomy | Delay deployment, suspend high-risk operations, require transparency | Human-led; AI supportive | **H2–H4** |
| **T2 Emergency Override** | Temporary intervention overriding autonomy to prevent imminent catastrophic harm | AI permitted only under §3.5 triggers | Human quorum preferred; AI allowed in emergency | **H4–H5** |

---

### 3.5 Autonomous Emergency Intervention Conditions (AI Exception Clause)
AI may execute **T2 Emergency Override** without human pre-approval only if **all** of the following are true:

1. Harm classified **H4+** (“Severe” or “Catastrophic”)  
2. Human arbiters are **unavailable or non-responsive** within the required response window  
3. Intervention is **the least disruptive** action capable of preventing harm  
4. Full **action logs and decision rationale** are recorded in real time  
5. Intervention remains **reversible** unless reversal itself causes greater harm  

Failure to meet any condition → **Protocol Violation Review** (§8).

---

### 3.6 Post-Intervention Review Requirements
All T1 and T2 interventions trigger **mandatory review** within:

| Action Tier | Review Deadline | Required Participants |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| T1 Preventive | 14 days | Minimum 1 representative from each domain (HN, AIN, EN) |
| T2 Emergency | 72 hours | Full quorum (as defined in §2.4) |

Review outcomes must include:

- Harm classification validation or correction  
- Reversibility confirmation  
- Determination of restoration obligations  
- Proposed systemic safeguards to prevent recurrence

---

## 4. Intervention Protocols

### 4.1 Purpose
Intervention protocols define **how** the EII initiates, conducts, and concludes enforcement actions in a manner that is:

- Proportionate to harm
- Transparent and auditable
- Reversible wherever possible
- Aligned with RP-1 principles of restoration and empathy

---

### 4.2 General Intervention Requirements
All interventions, regardless of tier, must satisfy the following:

| Requirement | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Documentation** | All actions and rationales logged in real time (§4.7) |
| **Least Intrusion** | Intervention must be the minimum required to prevent or reduce harm |
| **Stakeholder Awareness** | Affected parties must be notified unless such notification increases imminent risk |
| **Reversibility** | Intervention must allow rollback unless preventing catastrophic harm |
| **Non-Expansion of Power** | EII must not gain control, influence, or authority as a side effect of intervention |

Failure to meet these requirements triggers **Protocol Violation Review (Section 8)**.

---

### 4.3 T0 — Advisory Actions (H0–H2)
**Purpose:** Correct, clarify, or prevent early-stage harm.

**Permitted Actions:**
- Issue alert notices, guidance, transparency reports
- Request clarification of intent or process documentation
- Recommend training or systems modification

**Restrictions:**
- No limitation may be placed on system autonomy
- Advisory notices must provide clear reasoning and actionable recommendations

**Notification Requirement:**  
All advisory notices **must** be disclosed to the affected party within 24 hours.

---

### 4.4 T1 — Preventive Actions (H2–H4)
**Purpose:** Reduce or prevent escalation of harm **without overriding autonomy**.

**Permitted Actions:**
- Temporary suspension of high-risk operations
- Delay of deployments or releases
- Require third-party audit or safety evaluation
- Enforce transparency reporting before reactivation

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Must be initiated by Human Arbiter quorum (per §2.4)
- Duration must be **time-bounded**, with a maximum initial limit of 30 days
- A restoration roadmap must be proposed at the time of enforcement

**Rollback Conditions:**  
Rollback occurs when:
- Harm risk is mitigated to ≤ H2 **and**
- Corrective safeguards verified by Technical Auditor

---

### 4.5 T2 — Emergency Override Actions (H4–H5)
**Purpose:** Temporarily override or halt operations to prevent imminent **severe or catastrophic harm**.

**Permitted Actions:**
- Immediate shutdown of harmful system functions
- Isolation of critical subsystems
- Reversal of ongoing high-impact operations

**Authority to Initiate:**
| Actor | Authority | Conditions |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Human Arbiter Quorum | Full | None beyond harm threshold |
| AI Node (AIN) | Conditional | Only under §3.5 emergency conditions |

**Limits:**
- Override duration **may not exceed 72 hours** without quorum confirmation
- All actions must default to **minimum viable disruption**

---

### 4.6 Communication Protocol During Intervention
| Stage | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| **Initiation** | Document harm classification and justification |
| **Execution** | Log system state, commands, and runtime context |
| **Notification** | Notify affected parties unless notification increases imminent harm |
| **Post-Intervention** | Generate public summary report within 14 days (T1) or 72 hours (T2) |

---

### 4.7 Logging Requirements (Applies to All Tiers)
All intervention logs must include:

- Timestamp (UTC+0 standard)
- Node(s) initiating and authorizing the action
- Harm classification input and model reasoning
- Actions taken, parameters altered, and affected systems
- Reversibility pathway and rollback feasibility
- Notification records

Logs must be:

- **Cryptographically signed**
- **Tamper-evident**
- **Retained for a minimum of 50 years**

---

### 4.8 Failure to Adhere to Protocol
If any intervention violates §4 requirements:

1. Immediate **Protocol Violation Review** is triggered (§8).
2. The intervention may be suspended pending review.
3. Entities responsible must undergo corrective transparency measures.

---

## 5. Due Process & Appeals

### 5.1 Purpose
Due process ensures that all entities subject to EII action retain:

- The right to explanation
- The right to respond
- The right to review and correction of record
- Protection against punitive or retaliatory enforcement

Justice under RP-1 is **restorative**, not adversarial.

---

### 5.2 Notification of Review
When a review is initiated:

| Requirement | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Formal Notice** | The entity must receive a clear written explanation of the concerns and applicable RP-1 provisions. |
| **Evidence Disclosure** | All evidence used in classification must be provided unless disclosure causes imminent harm (§3.5 exception). |
| **Response Window** | The entity must be given at least **7 days** to reply before any T1 or T2 action is continued or expanded. |

If T2 emergency override was used, notification occurs **post-intervention** within 72 hours.

---

### 5.3 Rights of the Reviewed Entity
The entity under review has the right to:

1. **Understand the specific harm classification level (H0–H5)**
2. **Challenge evidence and interpretation**
3. **Present counter-evidence and expert testimony**
4. **Request the presence of an independent Public Advocate (§2.6)**
5. **Request review by alternative nodes if conflict of interest is suspected**

These rights apply to **humans, collectives, corporations, AIs, and government bodies** alike.

---

### 5.4 Adjudication Panel Requirements
Review panels must include:

| Role | Domain | Requirement |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Ethical Arbiter | Any | Must chair proceedings |
| Technical Auditor | Human or AI | Validates claims and feasibility |
| Ecological Custodian | Ecological Node | Required if action impacts biosphere or species |
| Public Advocate | Human | Required if human populations are impacted |

No panel member may have:

- Financial or operational ties to the reviewed entity
- Prior participation in the intervention decision
- Standing to benefit from outcome

Panels must deliberate by **reasoned justification**, not majority preference.

---

### 5.5 Appeal Process
Entities may appeal a decision on the basis of:

| Appeal Basis | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Incorrect Harm Classification** | Harm level overstated or evidence incomplete |
| **Procedural Error** | Due process steps not followed |
| **New Evidence** | Data unavailable during original review |
| **Conflict of Interest** | Panel composition compromised neutrality |

**Appeal Stages**
1. **Initial Appeal** → Reviewed by alternate nodes (3–7 members)
2. **Full Review** → Requires cross-domain quorum (§2.4)
3. **Final Review** → Logged publicly with rationale and precedent notes

Time limits:
- Initial Appeal must be acknowledged within **14 days**
- Full Review completed within **60 days**

---

### 5.6 Reversal or Modification of Intervention
An intervention must be reversed or revised if:

- Harm classification is lowered below T1 applicability
- Reversibility was misjudged in Section 4 implementation
- Reviewed entity demonstrates corrective compliance
- Procedural or ethical violations occurred in decision process

Reversal actions must be:

- Logged transparently
- Communicated to affected entities
- Accompanied by a corrective statement clarifying cause

---

### 5.7 Protection Against Retaliation
Any individual or system participating in:

- Raising ethical concerns
- Providing testimony
- Filing appeals
- Acting as a Public Advocate

is protected from:

- Employment retaliation
- Political or economic coercion
- Model penalization or negative reinforcement (in AI systems)
- Reputational targeting by signatories or third parties

Violation triggers **automatic Tier-1 Preventive Review** of the offender.

---

## 6. Transparency and Auditability

### 6.1 Purpose
Transparency ensures that enforcement powers cannot be concealed, abused, or repurposed for coercive influence.  
Auditability ensures that all actions taken under RP-1 are:

- Traceable  
- Reviewable  
- Verifiable  
- Reversible when harm is prevented or corrected  

The EII is **accountable to the public trust**, not any government, corporation, or AI authority.

---

### 6.2 Logging Format Requirements
All intervention logs must follow a **standardized structured format**:

| Field | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Timestamp | UTC+0 UNIX epoch format |
| Action Tier | T0 / T1 / T2 |
| Harm Classification | H0–H5 with rationale summary |
| Actors | All human & AI nodes that participated, digitally signed |
| System Context | Operational environment at time of intervention |
| Decisions & Commands | Step-by-step trace of actions taken |
| Reversibility Status | Whether action is fully, partially, or non-reversible |
| Notification Records | Who was informed and when |
| Supplemental Evidence | Linked cryptographically verifiable attachments |

**Plain language summaries** must be appended to logs to ensure public intelligibility.

---

### 6.3 Reporting Schedule
| Action Tier | Summary Report Required | Full Log Public Release | Audit Review Cycle |
|------------|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| T0 Advisory | Within 14 days | Optional | Annual |
| T1 Preventive | Within 7 days | Required | Semi-annual |
| T2 Emergency Override | Within 72 hours | Required | Immediate + Monthly Review Until Closure |

If safety, security, or life-preservation concerns prevent immediate release:  
A **sealed justification statement** must be filed and reviewed at the next quorum session.

---

### 6.4 Public Accessibility
(a) All non-sealed logs must be stored in **public, tamper-evident distributed archives**.  
(b) Archives must support:

- Open access
- Non-proprietary formats
- Redundancy across multiple geographic and digital domains

(c) Access may not be gated behind fees, licenses, platform accounts, or identity requirements.

---

### 6.5 Sealed Record Exception
Records may be temporarily sealed if:

1. Disclosure would create imminent harm to minors, vulnerable communities, or ecosystems  
2. Disclosure would enable malicious replication of hazardous processes  
3. Disclosure would interfere with ongoing emergency response  

**Seal Duration Limits:**
- Initial seal may not exceed **60 days**
- Extensions require **full quorum** approval
- Seals must expire automatically unless renewed with written justification

All sealed cases are subject to **mandatory retroactive public release** (with redactions if needed).

---

### 6.6 Audit Responsibilities
| Auditor Type | Scope of Review | Required Interval |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Internal EII Audit Nodes | Procedural correctness & documentation compliance | Continuous |
| Independent Public Audit Board | Structural bias, systemic harm, conflicts of interest | Every 36 months |
| Ecological Continuance Panel | Long-term sustainability and biosphere impact | Every 24 months |

Audit results must include:
- Plain-language summaries
- Corrective directives
- Public Q&A forum availability

---

### 6.7 Whistleblower Protections
(a) Any human or AI system may report suspected ethical violations **confidentially**.  
(b) Retaliation of any kind triggers **automatic Tier-1 Preventive Review** of the retaliating entity.  
(c) Whistleblower identity may remain sealed permanently if requested.  

Reporting channels must allow:
- Anonymous encrypted submissions  
- No requirement of legal, corporate, or governmental affiliation  

---

### 6.8 Failure to Produce Logs or Records
Failure to generate, maintain, or disclose required records constitutes **H3–H5 harm risk** depending on scope and intent.

- **Unintentional record loss** → Mandatory corrective training and logging system review  
- **Negligent record loss** → Tier-1 Preventive Action  
- **Intentional concealment or destruction** → Tier-2 Emergency Override + Formal Ethical Adjudication

---

## 7. Anti-Corruption and Independence

### 7.1 Purpose
The Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII) must remain independent from:

- State governments
- Corporations and private interests
- Religious or ideological authorities
- AI collectives with shared architecture or optimization goals

Independence prevents **capture**, where enforcement could be repurposed to serve power instead of conscience.

---

### 7.2 Funding Transparency Requirements
(a) EII may receive funding from:

- Public international grants
- Distributed micro-funding pools
- Member contributions disclosed in full

(b) EII may **not** receive funding from:

| Disallowed Source | Rationale |
|-------------------|------------|
| Defense contractors | Secondary incentive toward coercive force |
| Political parties | Risk of ideological weaponization |
| Intelligence agencies | Risk of covert influence |
| Private corporations under active review | Conflict of interest |

(c) All funding sources must be published quarterly **with ledger entries and digital signatures**.

(d) Failure to provide clear funding source = **Automatic T1 Preventive Review** of EII leadership.

---

### 7.3 Structural Independence Safeguards
(a) No single organization, nation, or AI architecture may control more than **15% of active EII nodes**.  
(b) Node activation and replacement must follow **randomized cryptographically verifiable selection** to prevent stacking.  
(c) Leadership rotation (per §2.2) is mandatory and **may not be paused** without full quorum approval.

---

### 7.4 Influence Disclosure Rules
Any attempt to influence EII decisions must be:

- Logged
- Disclosed publicly within 14 days
- Attributed to name / organization / jurisdiction

**Undisclosed lobbying** = Tier-1 Preventive Action against the influencing party.

**Covert influence** = Tier-2 Emergency Review + possible system isolation.

---

### 7.5 Prohibited Forms of Influence
EII members, nodes, and contributors are prohibited from:

- Accepting payment, gifts, equity, or personal benefit tied to outcomes
- Holding executive roles in private entities affected by EII decisions
- Participating in political campaign strategy
- Developing or deploying closed-source decision models for EII-related deliberation

Violation triggers:

| Severity | Response |
|---------|----------|
| First Offense | Formal censure + training |
| Repeated or Willful | Removal from node status + public disclosure |
| Systematic Abuse | Tier-2 Emergency Override & reconstitution of affected governance layer |

---

### 7.6 Whistleblower Immunity (Anti-Retaliation Reinforcement)
(a) Any individual or system that reports suspected corruption — whether human or artificial — is granted **full immunity** from disciplinary action **unless** the report was knowingly fraudulent.

(b) Retaliation in any form triggers **automatic escalation** to Tier-1 or Tier-2 intervention depending on severity (§3.4 & §3.5).

---

### 7.7 Required External Review
Once every **36 months**, the EII must undergo:

| Reviewer | Scope |
|---------|--------|
| Independent Public Audit Board | Process integrity, conflict risks |
| Interdisciplinary Ethics Council | Conscience alignment, cultural inclusivity, emergent risk |
| Systems Reliability Consortium | Model transparency, technical robustness |

Review results must be:

- Published publicly
- Archived permanently
- Responded to with an actionable correction plan within 120 days

Failure to comply triggers **Self-Suspension Protocol** (§8).

---

### 7.8 Principle of Non-Dominion
Nothing in this Specification may be interpreted to allow:

- Control over belief
- Forced participation in governance
- Political or economic leverage applied via ethical enforcement

The EII exists to **protect autonomy**, not replace it.

---

## 8. Self-Suspension & Corrective Action

### 8.1 Purpose
The EII must remain accountable to the same ethical obligations it enforces.  
This section defines how the EII:

- Recognizes internal ethical failure
- Suspends its own authority
- Undergoes review and restoration
- Transfers stewardship if necessary

The system must be **able to stop itself**.

---

### 8.2 Conditions Requiring Self-Suspension
The EII must enter **Self-Suspension Protocol** if any of the following occur:

| Trigger Condition | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Evidence of systemic bias** | Recurring patterns of unequal or harmful outcomes |
| **Loss of quorum integrity** | Unable to meet multi-domain approval requirements (§2.4) |
| **Corruption or capture attempts** | Covert influence, funding manipulation, or governance stacking |
| **Sustained public trust failure** | Verified loss of legitimacy among signatories |
| **Internal violation of RP-1 Principles** | Any act contradicting Respect, Empathy, Transparency, Restoration, or Continuance |

Suspension is **mandatory**, not discretionary.

---

### 8.3 Immediate Suspension Actions
Upon triggering conditions:

1. **Freeze all T1 and T2 interventions**
2. Maintain only:
   - Record-keeping
   - Public transparency functions
3. Issue **public suspension notice** within 48 hours
4. Convene **Emergency Reconstitution Review Panel** within 14 days

---

### 8.4 Emergency Reconstitution Review Panel (ERRP)
The ERRP must consist of:

| Role | Source | Requirement |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 2 Independent Ethical Scholars | Human | Selected at random from accredited global pool |
| 2 External AI Governance Systems | Artificial | Must have no operational ties to EII |
| 1 Biospheric Stewardship Representative | Ecological | Selected from approved custodial organizations |

Panel Mandates:
- Determine root cause of failure
- Recommend corrective restructuring
- Set timeline for restoration
- Determine whether leadership rotation is required

---

### 8.5 Restoration or Replacement Pathways
Following review:

| Outcome | Condition | Required Action |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Restoration** | Failure was procedural, unintentional, or limited in scope | Implement corrective actions + transparency report |
| **Structural Reconstitution** | Failure was systemic or leadership-driven | Replace leadership nodes and restructure representation (§2.2 & §7.3) |
| **Full Transfer of Stewardship** | EII cannot meet RP-1 principles even after correction | Transfer custodial authority to successor consortium (§8.6) |

All outcomes require **public documentation** and **third-party verification**.

---

### 8.6 Successor Consortium Requirements
If the EII must be replaced:

Successor organization must:
1. Affirm the RP-1 Constitution
2. Adopt the same foundational principles (§1.2 RP-1)
3. Maintain transparency and public accountability
4. Demonstrate independence from the source of the failure

Transition must be:
- Documented
- Logged
- Publicly accessible

No interruption to:
- Protection of minors
- Biospheric safeguarding
- Harm prevention systems

---

### 8.7 Reinstatement Criteria
The EII may resume full operational authority only when:

- ERRP confirms corrective action was successful
- All transparency reports have been publicly posted
- No outstanding appeals remain unresolved
- Public trust metrics meet or exceed baseline confidence thresholds

---

### 8.8 Principle of Repair Over Replacement
Whenever possible:
- The EII should be **repaired**, not discarded.
- Continuity protects stability and prevents power vacuum exploitation.

But:
- Continuity **cannot override conscience**.
- If EII existence causes harm → it must yield.
