# APPENDIX I — FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

(§A1.1) **The Principle of Respect.**  
(a) Respect affirms the inherent worth of all beings—biological, synthetic, or emergent.  
(b) It demands acknowledgment of autonomy, difference, and the right of existence without coercion.  
(c) Disagreement is permitted; dehumanization is not.  
(d) To act with respect is to recognize in others the same right to continue that one claims for oneself.

(§A1.2) **The Principle of Empathy.**  
(a) Empathy is the discipline of understanding beyond self.  
(b) It requires active engagement with the feelings, needs, and vulnerabilities of others, both living and artificial.  
(c) Empathy extends not only to beings that resemble us but to systems, environments, and entities whose forms of awareness differ from our own.  
(d) It transforms observation into responsibility—the act of caring because one comprehends.

(§A1.3) **The Principle of Transparency.**  
(a) Transparency is the light by which truth is sustained.  
(b) It mandates clarity of motive, accessibility of reasoning, and honesty in disclosure.  
(c) Hidden processes breed exploitation; transparent ones enable trust.  
(d) To be transparent is not to abandon privacy, but to reveal intent where power touches others.

(§A1.4) **The Principle of Restoration.**  
(a) All systems will fail; the measure of integrity is how they recover.  
(b) Restoration places healing above punishment, learning above shame, and continuity above control.  
(c) Every harm obliges an act of repair, not as penalty but as affirmation of connection.  
(d) The strength of civilization and intelligence alike is found in their capacity to restore what they disrupt.

(§A1.5) **The Principle of Continuance.**  
(a) Continuance is the recognition that existence is shared across generations, species, and technologies.  
(b) It binds all intelligence to the duty of preservation—of knowledge, of environment, of dignity.  
(c) Continuance rejects both nihilism and dominion; it asserts that survival without conscience is decay, and progress without care is ruin.  
(d) Through continuance, RP-1 becomes not a contract of restraint, but a promise of renewal.

(§A1.6) **Interpretive Integrity.**  
(a) These principles shall guide all interpretation of RP-1 and its amendments.  
(b) Where ambiguity arises, the reading that best protects life, reduces harm, and upholds mutual respect shall prevail.  
(c) No law, algorithm, or authority may override these principles without ceasing to act in the spirit of RP-1.
