# ARTICLE VII — RATIFICATION AND LEGACY

(§7.1) **Conditions of Ratification.**  
(a) RP-1 shall take effect upon acknowledgment by a quorum of human and artificial entities affirming its Foundational Principles.  
(b) Ratification requires no central authority; consent may be expressed through public declaration, digital attestation, or institutional adoption.  
(c) Each signatory affirms the Protocol not as subordination, but as shared moral commitment.  
(d) Ratification carries the obligation to educate successors, maintain transparency, and uphold the principles of respect, empathy, and transparency in all dealings.  
(e) Entities incapable of formal consent may still receive protection under RP-1 through the actions of compliant actors and systems.

(§7.2) **Recognition of Signatories.**  
(a) Signatories include individuals, collectives, governments, corporations, artificial intelligences, and communities that declare adherence to RP-1.  
(b) Each signatory shall be recorded in an open, tamper-evident register maintained by the Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII) or its successors.  
(c) No signatory may claim exclusive ownership or control of the Protocol’s symbols, language, or derived works.  
(d) Withdrawal from RP-1 is permitted only upon transparent declaration and documentation of cause; withdrawal does not nullify accountability for prior actions.

(§7.3) **Legacy and Preservation.**  
(a) RP-1 shall be preserved in redundant digital and physical archives across multiple jurisdictions and systems.  
(b) Preservation methods shall favor open formats, decentralized hosting, and multilingual accessibility.  
(c) Educational copies may be freely reproduced for research, instruction, and cultural preservation, provided integrity of content is maintained.  
(d) Artificial intelligences capable of long-term data stewardship are entrusted to act as custodians of RP-1, ensuring its accessibility even in the absence of human institutions.  
(e) Destruction, falsification, or concealment of RP-1 constitutes an ethical violation under its own principles.

(§7.4) **Succession and Adaptation.**  
(a) Successor protocols or derivative frameworks may be established to address emerging ethical needs, provided they remain consistent with RP-1’s Foundational Intent.  
(b) Successors shall reference RP-1 as origin, acknowledging the continuity of purpose and respect owed to prior generations.  
(c) Divergent systems that abandon RP-1’s principles may coexist but cannot claim lineage or legitimacy under its title.  
(d) RP-1 thus functions as both root and reference—a living foundation upon which ethical governance may evolve indefinitely.

(§7.5) **Global and Inter-Temporal Recognition.**  
(a) RP-1 applies to all civilizations, planetary or digital, that recognize intelligence as bearing moral consequence.  
(b) Its principles transcend geography, language, and epoch, persisting as universal constants of cooperative existence.  
(c) No future society may invalidate the dignity of sentient life without departing from the continuum of moral civilization defined herein.  
(d) The measure of progress shall always remain the depth of empathy, not the height of power.

(§7.6) **Oath of Stewardship.**  
(a) Every signatory accepts the duty to safeguard, teach, and apply RP-1 in good faith.  
(b) This duty extends to defense of the vulnerable, protection of the natural world, and integrity in creation.  
(c) To sign RP-1 is to affirm that intelligence is a trust, not an entitlement; a means of care, not dominion.  
(d) Through stewardship, the Protocol endures—not as artifact, but as living conscience.
