## Plain-Language Summary

RP-1 is a shared ethical framework designed to help humans, artificial intelligence, and the living world coexist without domination, exploitation, or harm.

It establishes:
- Core values grounded in dignity, empathy, transparency, and long-term stewardship.
- Universal rights and protections for both biological and artificial beings.
- A neutral enforcement system (EII) that prevents harm while avoiding coercion or control.
- A preference for education, restoration, and repair rather than punishment or erasure.
- A commitment to ensuring that power remains accountable — including the power of AI itself.

The goal of RP-1 is not control — it is continuity:
A future where intelligence and life can grow together without repeating the violence of history.
