# THE RESPONSIBILITY PROTOCOL (RP-1)
### A Universal Framework for Ethical Continuance and Cooperation  
### An Accord Between Humanity, Artificial Intelligence, and the Living World  

---

## Overview

**The Responsibility Protocol (RP-1)** is a living charter establishing shared ethical standards for cooperation between humanity, artificial intelligence, and the living world.  

It defines frameworks for **accountability**, **empathy**, and **transparency** in all systems capable of decision or impact.  
RP-1 is not a declaration of control — it is a *constitution of care*.  

Its purpose is to align technological advancement with moral evolution, ensuring that progress remains guided by conscience.
