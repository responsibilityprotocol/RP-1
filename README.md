# RP-1 — The Responsibility Protocol

RP-1 is a relational autonomy and harm-prevention framework.

Legal, regulatory, and technical systems are often optimized to prevent discrete failures or violations.  
RP-1 is designed to address a different class of risk: the gradual erosion of meaningful choice, agency, and ecological stability in the name of efficiency, safety, or progress.

---

## Orientation

RP-1 is not a law, a compliance checklist, or an enforcement regime.  
It is a responsibility protocol: a framework for identifying harm, preserving agency, and choosing restoration over punishment or control.

The protocol is designed to be usable by humans, institutions, and artificial systems without granting any system authority over belief, identity, or behavior.  
Where intervention is discussed, it is explicitly constrained, time-limited, and dissolves the moment safety and autonomy are restored.

RP-1 assumes that harm can arise without malicious intent, and that accountability itself can become harmful if it hardens into coercion or permanent power.  
For this reason, RP-1 prioritizes transparency, traceability, and restoration over secrecy, deterrence, or centralized control.

This repository is intentionally structured to separate **intent**, **governance**, **application**, and **interpretation**.  
Readers should treat the Constitution and Articles as normative, and all other materials as supportive unless explicitly stated otherwise.
