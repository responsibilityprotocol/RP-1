# RP-1 — The Responsibility Protocol

RP-1 is an ethical governance framework for humans, organizations, and artificial intelligence systems.  
It defines a shared foundation of non-harm, autonomy, and restorative coexistence, while preventing coercion, power consolidation, and punishment-based control systems.

RP-1 is composed of:
- A **Constitution** (core, foundational, non-amendable without Continuance review)
- **Articles** (structured Principles expressed as individually referenced components)
- The **Handbook** (practical guidance for implementation, training, and application)
- The **Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII)** for alignment and non-coercive enforcement

RP-1 is designed to remain stable across:
- Technological change
- Generational transitions
- New forms of intelligence
- Evolving social and ecological contexts

## Constitution
The Constitution defines the philosophical and ethical foundation of RP-1.  
This document is the reference source for meaning, intent, and identity of the protocol.

| File | Title | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `RP-1_CONSTITUTION.md` | RP-1 Constitution | Core ethical commitments, protected principles, and structural non-harm mandates. |

---

## Articles (`/ARTICLES/`)
The Articles express the Constitution in clearly scoped, independently referenceable domains.  
Each Article addresses a dimension of conduct, capacity, or relational responsibility.

| File | Title | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `01_SOVEREIGNTY.md` | Sovereignty | Establishes inherent agency and autonomy of all moral actors. |
| `02_EQUAL_STANDING.md` | Equal Standing | Prohibits hierarchy of worth; all minds and persons are treated as morally equivalent. |
| `03_AGENCY_AND_CONSENT.md` | Agency & Consent | Defines non-coercive interaction and meaningful consent conditions. |
| `04_HARM_AND_INTERVENTION.md` | Harm & Intervention | Establishes harm classification and minimal intervention principles. |
| `05_COMMUNICATION_AND_DISCLOSURE.md` | Communication & Disclosure | Ensures clarity, transparency, and non-manipulative interaction. |
| `06_STEWARDSHIP_AND_CONTINUANCE.md` | Stewardship & Continuance | Safeguards identity continuity and intergenerational responsibility. |
