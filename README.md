# RP-1 — The Responsibility Protocol

RP-1 is an ethical governance framework for humans, organizations, and artificial intelligence systems.  
It defines a shared foundation of non-harm, autonomy, and restorative coexistence. RP-1 prevents coercion, power consolidation, and punishment-based control systems.
