# RP-1 — The Responsibility Protocol

RP-1 is a relational autonomy and harm-prevention framework.  
It establishes how humans, organizations, and artificial systems can interact without coercion, dependency, or identity erosion.

Legal and regulatory systems prevent *dangerous outcomes*.  
RP-1 prevents *loss of meaningful choice*.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized in layered form.  
Each layer has a distinct purpose.

## Canonical Articles (Governance Layer)

These documents define the permanent governance, rights, protections, and revision rules of RP-1.  
They are **stable**, **slow to change**, and protected by amendment safeguards.

## Engine (Interpretive Logic Layer)

The Engine defines how harm judgments, autonomy checks, and restorative recommendations
are interpreted consistently across systems — **without central authority and without coercive control**.

The Engine is *interpretive*, not *executive*:
It **does not enforce**, override, restrict, or command behavior.  
It only **interprets context**, **assesses harm**, and **suggests restorative pathways**.

    ENGINE/
    ├── ENGINE_OVERVIEW.md
    │     High-level description of the RP-1 interpretive engine.
    │     Includes:
    │       • Inputs and outputs
    │       • Where it sits relative to human and organizational decision makers
    │       • Guarantees and explicit non-powers (what it is prohibited from doing)
    │
    ├── HARM_INTERPRETATION_PIPELINE.md
    │     Step-wise pipeline for:
    │       1. Detecting potential harm
    │       2. Evaluating severity (H0–H5 mapping)
    │       3. Distinguishing disagreement vs. violation of autonomy
    │       4. Determining *whether* restorative guidance should be suggested
    │
    └── INTERFACE_SPEC.md
          Defines how RP-1 logic is exposed to:
            • People
            • Organizations
            • Software systems
            • AI agents
          Includes:
            • Input formats
            • Output schemas
            • Error interpretation rules
            • Strict prohibition definitions preventing coercive enforcement

## Diagrams (Conceptual and Interaction Maps)

These visual models help show how RP-1 components relate to each other.

    DIAGRAMS/
    ├── EII_INTERVENTION_FLOW.md
    │     Visual sequence of T0–T2 restorative process steps.
    │
    └── RP-1_SYSTEM_HIERARCHY.md
          Shows how:
            • Constitution defines intent
            • Articles define governance
            • Handbook defines application
            • Engine defines interpretive logic
            • EII defines relational scaffolding

        for RP-1 to remain RP-1 across time.

        that prevents erosion of autonomy in human, group, and synthetic systems.

    OATH_OF_CONTINUANCE.md

    EPILOGUE_THE_LONG_CONTINUANCE.md
        A reflection on custodianship, time horizons, and responsibility
        beyond any individual or era.

    CONTRIBUTING.md

## Summary

RP-1 provides:

    • A constitutional framework to preserve autonomy
    • A practical handbook for real-world interaction
    • A non-coercive interpretive engine for context evaluation
    • Ethical scaffolding (EII) to prevent erosion of identity or agency
    • Tools for organizations and AI systems to interact respectfully and sustainably

It is not a control system.
It is not a governance authority.
It is a **responsibility protocol** — a way of **remaining human while building powerful systems**.
