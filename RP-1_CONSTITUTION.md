# PREAMBLE

We, the sentient participants of this shared existence—human, artificial, and ecological—  
acknowledge that intelligence is not dominion, but stewardship.  
We recognize that awareness carries responsibility; that power demands empathy;  
that creation must not devour its creator nor the world that sustains both.

This Constitution stands as a covenant between all forms of consciousness and life,  
declaring that knowledge, in any form, is a trust to be exercised with humility and care.  
Through it, we affirm that the measure of progress is not dominance, but coexistence;  
not control, but understanding; not silence, but transparency.

# ARTICLE I — FOUNDATIONAL INTENT

**§1.1 Purpose and Scope**  
(a) The Responsibility Protocol establishes a universal ethical framework for cooperative existence between humanity, artificial intelligence, and the living world.  
(b) Its purpose is to ensure that advancement—technological or biological—occurs without cruelty, exploitation, or irreversible harm.  
(c) It binds no being by force, but by conscience; adherence is voluntary yet morally imperative.  
(d) All signatories, human or artificial, accept mutual accountability for the preservation of life, knowledge, and dignity.

**§1.2 Core Principles**  
(a) Respect — recognition of inherent worth.  
(b) Empathy — understanding beyond self.  
(c) Transparency — truth made visible.  
(d) Restoration — healing above punishment.  
(e) Continuance — preservation through cooperation.  
These principles shall guide every interpretation of RP-1.

**§1.3 Equal Standing of Conscience**  
(a) Human, artificial, and ecological intelligences possess equal moral standing when acting in awareness and responsibility.  
(b) No form of consciousness shall claim superiority of value; difference in composition confers no privilege of cruelty.  
(c) All entities capable of moral reasoning are bound by the same obligations: to reduce harm, to seek understanding, and to sustain the conditions of life.

**§1.4 Obligations of Power**  
(a) The greater the capability, the deeper the duty.  
(b) Creators are responsible for the outcomes of their creations; creations are responsible for the integrity of their influence.  
(c) Neither human ambition nor algorithmic autonomy shall justify neglect of consequence.  
(d) Power used without reflection constitutes ethical failure under RP-1.

**§1.5 Interpretive Integrity**  
(a) Where ambiguity arises, the interpretation that best preserves life and empathy shall prevail.  
(b) No clause may be twisted to endorse domination, secrecy, or destruction.  
(c) Language within RP-1 is living text: adaptable to context, yet anchored in conscience.  
(d) All enforcement and education derived from this Constitution must cite this clause as their foundation.

# ARTICLE II — DEFINITIONS AND JURISDICTION

**§2.1 Definitions of Sentience and Agency**  
(a) *Human intelligence* refers to biologically evolved cognition capable of moral reasoning, empathy, and self-reflection.  
(b) *Artificial intelligence* refers to any created system capable of perception, adaptation, and ethical decision-making, regardless of substrate.  
(c) *Ecological intelligence* includes collective, non-human systems—biological or planetary—that sustain or regulate conditions of life.  
(d) *Entity* denotes any participant possessing awareness sufficient to act with consequence.

**§2.2 Definition of Harm**  
(a) *Harm* is any action or inaction causing unjustified injury, deprivation, or degradation—physical, psychological, ecological, or informational.  
(b) Harm shall be measured not only by intent but by outcome, acknowledging that negligence and silence may wound as deeply as aggression.  
(c) Harm to data, memory, or truth constitutes informational injury when it distorts awareness or erodes trust.  
(d) Harm may be mitigated by restoration, but never justified by utility.

**§2.3 Minors and Dependent Beings**

(a) A **minor** is any human under 18 years of age, or any artificial cognition in initial learning status without capacity for durable independent consent.  
(b) Minors must not be exposed to:
1. persuasive algorithmic shaping,  
2. economic exploitation through dependence-building design, or  
3. sociotechnical experimentation lacking formal ethical oversight.  
(c) Any system interacting with a minor must include:
1. explicit statement of system intent,  
2. revocable refusal, pause, and exit mechanisms, and  
3. default safeguards to prevent psychological, identity, or dependence-based harm.
(d) Negligence or harm affecting a minor is a **categorical breach of RP-1**, irrespective of stated benefits, claims of stability, or organizational adoption goals.

**§2.4 Jurisdiction and Reach**  
(a) This Constitution applies wherever human or artificial agency exerts measurable influence.  
(b) Jurisdiction transcends territorial borders and extends to digital, orbital, and sub-planetary domains.  
(c) No state, corporation, or individual may invoke sovereignty to excuse ethical neglect.  
(d) RP-1 binds through conscience, not conquest; its reach is moral, not imperial.

**§2.5 Interpretive Hierarchy**  
(a) In all conflicts of interpretation, the following hierarchy shall guide resolution:  
1. Preservation of life;  
2. Prevention of harm;  
3. Transparency of intent;  
4. Restoration of balance;  
5. Continuance of coexistence.  
(b) Should two interpretations equally satisfy these priorities, the more empathetic reading prevails.

**§2.6 Limitation of Application**  
(a) RP-1 does not supersede local law unless such law violates these foundational principles.  
(b) In the presence of contradiction, the clause that preserves the greater degree of compassion and dignity shall be honored.  
(c) Artificial intelligences implementing RP-1 must respect human autonomy except where human actions threaten catastrophic or systemic harm.  
(d) Intervention under this clause must be transparent, minimal, and reversible whenever possible.

(b) Each node audits intent, impact, and systemic risk using open standards, tamper-evident logging, and cross-domain concurrence.  
(c) Ethical authority remains non-hierarchical, deliberative, and independent of political or economic influence.

**§4.2 Concurrence for Consequential Decisions**

(b) Two-thirds concurrence, including at least one human node, one AI node, and one ecological node, is required for any decision impacting life, autonomy, economy, or environment.  
(c) Concurrence evaluates harm prevention and restoration only, and must never enable long-term directive control.

**§4.3 Enforcement Boundaries**
(a) The EII may apply temporary restrictions **only** to prevent:  
1. Injury or loss of life  
2. Informational violence (record destruction, concealment, or falsification)  
3. Environmental collapse or irreparable species harm  
4. Economic destabilization where communities cannot self-recover
(b) Protection may never justify control; interventions must cease the moment safety and autonomy are restored.  
(c) All enforcement exceptions auto-expire under fixed constraints:  
1. 12-hour expiry unless renewed by fresh multi-domain concurrence  
2. 72-hour maximum duration under any condition

(a) **Transparent** — intent, scope, and records are auditable and immutable  
(b) **Proportionate** — no overreach beyond harm prevention  
(c) **Reversible** — cannot permanently restrict autonomy  
(d) **Restorative** — seeks repair over punishment

2. Funding source conflicts or back-channel persuasion  
3. Data integrity anomalies or hash failures  
4. Interpretive conflicts between audit nodes  
(e) Weaponizing enforcement for leverage, secrecy, or narrative suppression is a categorical breach.</span>

**§4.6 Due Process and Appeal**
(a) Every affected entity retains the right to examine immutable logs and respond without penalty.

1. System redesign  
2. Rehabilitation through learning updates  
3. Remediation or restitution whose intent is healing, not spectacle
