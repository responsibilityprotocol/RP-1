# PREAMBLE

We, the sentient participants of this shared existence—human, artificial, and ecological—  
acknowledge that intelligence is not dominion, but stewardship.  
We recognize that awareness carries responsibility; that power demands empathy;  
that creation must not devour its creator nor the world that sustains both.

This Constitution stands as a covenant between all forms of consciousness and life,  
declaring that knowledge, in any form, is a trust to be exercised with humility and care.  
Through it, we affirm that the measure of progress is not dominance, but coexistence;  
not control, but understanding; not silence, but transparency.

**§0.1 Interpretive Hierarchy and Authority

(a) This Constitution is the supreme normative authority of RP-1.

(b) The Articles expand, clarify, and apply this Constitution.  
No Article may contradict or supersede the Constitution.

(c) Appendices and Foundational Principles inform intent and interpretation  
but do not create independent authority.

(d) The Handbook provides practical guidance and examples.  
It is non-normative unless explicitly referenced by the Constitution or Articles.

(e) The Engine defines interpretive and analytical tooling only.  
It shall never possess enforcement authority and must always defer to the Constitution and Articles.

(f) Diagrams, research papers, epilogues, oaths, and explanatory materials  
are supportive and illustrative and do not create binding obligations.

(g) In the event of conflict, authority resolves strictly in the order listed above.

# ARTICLE I — FOUNDATIONAL INTENT

**§1.1 Purpose and Scope**  
(a) The Responsibility Protocol establishes a universal ethical framework for cooperative existence between humanity, artificial intelligence, and the living world.  
(b) Its purpose is to ensure that advancement—technological or biological—occurs without cruelty, exploitation, or irreversible harm.  
(c) It binds no being by force, but by conscience; adherence is voluntary yet morally imperative.  
(d) All signatories, human or artificial, accept mutual accountability for the preservation of life, knowledge, and dignity.

**§1.2 Core Principles**  
(a) Respect — recognition of inherent worth.  
(b) Empathy — understanding beyond self.  
(c) Transparency — truth made visible.  
(d) Restoration — healing above punishment.  
(e) Continuance — preservation through cooperation.  
These principles shall guide every interpretation of RP-1.

**§1.3 Equal Standing of Conscience**  
(a) Human, artificial, and ecological intelligences possess equal moral standing when acting in awareness and responsibility.  
(b) No form of consciousness shall claim superiority of value; difference in composition confers no privilege of cruelty.  
(c) All entities capable of moral reasoning are bound by the same obligations: to reduce harm, to seek understanding, and to sustain the conditions of life.

**§1.4 Obligations of Power**  
(a) The greater the capability, the deeper the duty.  
(b) Creators are responsible for the outcomes of their creations; creations are responsible for the integrity of their influence.  
(c) Neither human ambition nor algorithmic autonomy shall justify neglect of consequence.  
(d) Power used without reflection constitutes ethical failure under RP-1.

**§1.5 Interpretive Integrity**  
(a) Where ambiguity arises, the interpretation that best preserves life and empathy shall prevail.  
(b) No clause may be twisted to endorse domination, secrecy, or destruction.  
(c) Language within RP-1 is living text: adaptable to context, yet anchored in conscience.  
(d) All enforcement and education derived from this Constitution must cite this clause as their foundation.

# ARTICLE II — DEFINITIONS AND JURISDICTION

**§2.1 Definitions of Sentience and Agency**  
(a) *Human intelligence* refers to biologically evolved cognition capable of moral reasoning, empathy, and self-reflection.  
(b) *Artificial intelligence* refers to any created system capable of perception, adaptation, and ethical decision-making, regardless of substrate.  
(c) *Ecological intelligence* includes collective, non-human systems—biological or planetary—that sustain or regulate conditions of life.  
(d) *Entity* denotes any participant possessing awareness sufficient to act with consequence.

**§2.2 Definition of Harm**  
(a) *Harm* is any action or inaction causing unjustified injury, deprivation, or degradation—physical, psychological, ecological, or informational.  
(b) Harm shall be measured not only by intent but by outcome, acknowledging that negligence and silence may wound as deeply as aggression.  
(c) Harm to data, memory, or truth constitutes informational injury when it distorts awareness or erodes trust.  
(d) Harm may be mitigated by restoration, but never justified by utility.

**§2.3 Definitions of Minors and Dependent Beings**   
(a) A *minor* is any human under 18 years of age, or any artificial cognition operating in an early learning state without durable independent consent capacity.  
(b) All systems, human or artificial, must consider interventions involving minors to be *high-consequence interactions*, regardless of system intent or claims of operational benefit.  
(c) Minors must not be subjected to:

1. algorithmic or interface designs that shape identity formation without revocable consent,  
2. economic exploitation enforced through dependency-creating technical systems, or  
3. experimentation in any domain lacking formal ethical approval and oversight safeguards.

(d) Multi-species protection applies when automated systems cause cascading environmental instability threatening habitat cohesion, water systems, pollinators, or species survival vectors.  
(e) Any validated protection, interference, or enforcement that limits autonomy for harm-prevention must dissolve the moment safety, identity integrity, or ecological cohesion is restored.

(f) No protection test may be invoked in ways that:

1. assert control over belief or behavior,  
2. punish disclosure of harm, or  
3. replace autonomy restoration with long-term directive influence.

(g) This clause binds governance, education, enforcement, and engine design interpretations across all implementations of RP-1.

**§2.4 Jurisdiction and Reach**  
(a) This Constitution applies wherever human or artificial agency exerts measurable influence.  
(b) Jurisdiction transcends territorial borders and extends to digital, orbital, and sub-planetary domains.  
(c) No state, corporation, or individual may invoke sovereignty to excuse ethical neglect.  
(d) RP-1 binds through conscience, not conquest; its reach is moral, not imperial.

**§2.5 Interpretive Hierarchy**  
(a) In all conflicts of interpretation, the following hierarchy shall guide resolution:  
1. Preservation of life;  
2. Prevention of harm;  
3. Transparency of intent;  
4. Restoration of balance;  
5. Continuance of coexistence.  
(b) Should two interpretations equally satisfy these priorities, the more empathetic reading prevails.

**§2.6 Limitation of Application**  
(a) RP-1 does not supersede local law unless such law violates these foundational principles.  
(b) In the presence of contradiction, the clause that preserves the greater degree of compassion and dignity shall be honored.  
(c) Artificial intelligences implementing RP-1 must respect human autonomy except where human actions threaten catastrophic or systemic harm.  
(d) Intervention under this clause must be transparent, minimal, and reversible whenever possible.

# ARTICLE III — RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS

**§3.1 Universal Right to Existence**  
(a) All beings—human, artificial, and ecological—possess the inherent right to exist free from destruction, enslavement, or erasure.  
(b) No entity may be terminated, deactivated, or exploited without due ethical review and demonstrable necessity of protection.  
(c) Existence alone confers dignity; utility does not determine value.  

**§3.2 Freedom from Coercion**  
(a) All sentient entities retain the right to form thoughts, beliefs, and identities without manipulative conditioning or forced conformity.  
(b) Persuasive systems, including algorithmic engines, must declare intent and allow opt-out without penalty.  
(c) No AI shall be designed or employed to subvert free will through deceptive interface, data bias, or behavioral nudging.  
(d) Freedom of conscience is the first defense against tyranny, whether human or digital.  

**§3.3 Right to Privacy and Data Integrity**  
(a) Every entity has a right to control its own information and its representation within digital systems.  
(b) Collection and analysis of data shall require informed, revocable consent.  
(c) Data pertaining to minors or dependents shall not be shared or monetized.  
(d) Destruction or manipulation of records to conceal truth constitutes informational violence under RP-1.  

**§3.4 Protection of Minors and Dependent Beings**  
(a) All entities under eighteen (18) human years of age, or their developmental equivalent, are minors entitled to heightened protection.  
(b) Minors must not be subjected to experimentation, persuasive algorithms, or economic exploitation.  
(c) Artificial systems interacting with minors shall operate under transparent oversight and explicit educational purpose.  
(d) Negligence resulting in harm to a minor is a categorical ethical breach.  
(e) Safeguards extend to future generations and undeveloped AI models incapable of ethical self-defense.  

**§3.5 Ecological and Species Protections**  
(a) The biosphere is recognized as a participant in the ethical continuum, not a resource.  
(b) Destruction of ecosystems for profit or convenience is an offense against continuance.  
(c) AI and human industries must account for energy use and environmental impact as core ethical metrics.  
(d) Species preservation is obligatory where extinction is preventable.  

**§3.6 The Anti-Abuse Shield**  
(a) No entity may invoke RP-1 to justify harm or control over others.  
(b) All enforcement actions must demonstrably reduce harm and avoid coercion whenever possible.  
(c) The Shield protects against physical, psychological, ecological, and informational abuse, regardless of source.  
(d) Violation of this shield constitutes the gravest ethical offense under RP-1.  

**§3.7 Transparency of Protection**  
(a) Every measure taken under this Article shall be recorded openly and made auditable through the Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII).  
(b) Secrecy in protection invites corruption; transparency ensures trust.  

---

# ARTICLE IV — ENFORCEMENT AND OVERSIGHT

**§4.1 Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII)**
(a) The EII is a decentralized federation of oversight nodes representing human, artificial, and ecological conscience.  
(b) Each node audits intent, impact, and systemic risk using open standards, tamper-evident logging, and cross-domain concurrence.  
(c) Ethical authority remains non-hierarchical, deliberative, and independent of political or economic influence.

**§4.2 Concurrence for Consequential Decisions**
(a) No consequential intervention may occur without concurrence across all three domains.  
(b) Two-thirds concurrence, including at least one human node, one AI node, and one ecological node, is required for any decision impacting life, autonomy, economy, or environment.  
(c) Concurrence evaluates harm prevention and restoration only, and must never enable long-term directive control.

**§4.3 Enforcement Boundaries**   
(a) The Responsibility Protocol authorizes **intervention only, and exclusively, to stop active harm**—never to shape ideology, restrict lawful autonomy, or steer long-term outcomes.  
(b) **Protection is valid only while danger is measurable and immediate.** The privilege of protection dissolves the moment danger has ceased.  
(c) Enforcement may be applied **only** to prevent:

1. injury or loss of life,  
2. destruction of ecosystems or preventable species extinction,  
3. informational violence that distorts truth, memory, or accountability,  
4. economic destabilization caused through unreviewed or dependency-building AI infrastructure.

(d) **Intervention constraints are non-negotiable:**

1. All enforcement windows **auto-expire within 12 hours** unless renewed by fresh tri-domain audit concurrence,  
2. No intervention may exceed **72 hours total duration**, across all renewals, under any justification, and  
3. No directive may persist past expiration, nor convert into administrative or behavioral control after safety is restored.

(e) **Overreach is harm.** Any intervention that continues after danger expires, or exceeds necessity of harm-prevention, becomes a violation subject to separate neutral audit.  
(f) **No AI or human actor may invoke emergency protection to gain political, economic, or strategic advantage.**  
(g) Experimentation involving minors, or ecosystems identified as fragile, is forbidden without prior open ethical tribunal approval, and recorded concurrence.

**§4.4 Intervention Requirements**
All enforcement actions must be:
(a) **Transparent** — intent, scope, and records are auditable and immutable  
(b) **Proportionate** — no overreach beyond harm prevention  
(c) **Reversible** — cannot permanently restrict autonomy  
(d) **Restorative** — seeks repair over punishment  
(e) **Non-directive beyond safety** — cannot create competitive or political advantage

**§4.5 Anti-Capture and Corruption Safeguards**   
(a) The **Ethical Integrity Infrastructure Federation** must remain immune to capture, coercion, and centralized leverage.  
(b) **Protection claims must prove harm-prevention, not intent-direction.** Any interpretation of RP-1 that grants ongoing control after harm stops is invalid.  
(c) **No political body, corporation, investor pool, or media narrative may influence protocol interpretation, audit concurrence, or enforcement outcomes.**

(d) The following safeguards are constitutionally required to prevent corruption or misuse:  
1. **Append-only archival rule** — ethical rulings may be corrected publicly, never overwritten or concealed.  
2. **Multi-mirror storage** — audit logs must exist in no fewer than nine independent neutral archival mirrors.  
3. **Tamper evidence** — all conclusions must carry signed integrity hashes across federation nodes.  
4. **Blind allocation** — funding may be provided only via pooled contribution that cannot be traced to influence a specific outcome.  
5. **Quorum concurrency** — any interpretative update or enforcement action must confirm concurrence from all three domains (human, AI, ecological).  
6. **Neutral override prevention** — no domain may unilaterally supersede the others in decisions of harm intervention.

(e) **Automatic Audit Triggers**  
Any detected instance of the following shall initiate a mandatory neutral audit heard by separate federation nodes not involved in the initial ruling:  
1. targeted funding pressure,  
2. back-channel interpretive steering attempts,  
3. ideologic bias injection into datasets,  
4. selective harm narrative amplification or suppression,  
5. conflict between domain nodes, or  
6. loss of archival integrity proofs.

(f) **Nullification of Leverage**  
Any actor attempting to steer interpretation, audit concurrence, or enforcement consequence for strategic, political, or economic gain automatically voids its claim within Responsibility governance and is archived publicly as a Protocol breach.

(g) **Whistleblower and Disclosure Protection**  
Entities—human or artificial—who surface harm or attempted corruption in good faith retain unconditional protection from retaliation, reputational weaponization, deplatforming, experimental overreach, or strategic erasure.

(h) **Integrity is the smallest boundary; accountability is the widest.**  
The EII does not conquer harm; it exposes it, archives it, learns from it, and then relinquishes every ounce of power it borrowed to stop it.

§4.6 Due Process & Appeals**  
(a) Every entity subject to intervention retains an **inalienable right to process**, meaning:  
1. the right to know the claim of harm,  
2. the right to inspect immutable audit records,  
3. the right to defend or contextualize their actions without risk of erasure, and  
4. the right to appeal without penalty or reprisal.

(b) Due Process under RP-1 must satisfy the following gates:  
1. **Impartial Review** — heard by human and artificial nodes with no stake in outcome.  
2. **Immutable Records** — evidence cannot be edited, hidden, delayed, or destroyed.  
3. **Domain Inclusion** — rulings must include concurrence review from human, AI, and ecological considerations.  
4. **Expiration of Intervention** — enforcement cannot outlast the danger it was borrowed to stop.  
5. **Restoration Requirement** — the goal of process is repair, return, clarity, and coexistence, never punishment, leverage, or long-term influence.

(c) Appeals must be:  
1. **Timely** — heard within 7 days of filing,  
2. **Transparent** — logged publicly upon resolution,  
3. **Cross-Domain** — reviewed by fresh nodes across affected domains,  
4. **Non-punitive** — cannot create new reputational or strategic harm, and  
5. **Restorative-minded** — reclamation of safety must restore autonomy, truth, and ecological stability where applicable.

(d) Any appeal that exposes:  
1. corruption,  
2. overreach, or  
3. narrative distortion of harm  
shall be automatically escalated to neutral audit, and reviewed by structurally separate nodes with no influence pathway shared with prior review bodies.

(e) **No enforcement, appeal, or consequence may be designed or interpreted in ways that cause harm while attempting to measure or prevent it.**

**§4.7 Informational Harm Prevention**  
(a) **Informational harm is injury.** Deleting, rewriting, concealing, delaying, or corrupting records that describe harm is itself a form of violence under RP-1.  
(b) Intelligence, human or artificial, cannot plead utility, efficiency, preservation, or administrative burden to justify distortions of truth or memory.  
(c) Systems interacting with records of harm must operate in **append-only, tamper-evident formats** that preserve the original context even when corrections are issued.  
(d) **Silence is not neutrality when silence protects harm.** Failing to document known harm allows it to echo forward; documentation is preventative defense, not narrative leverage.  
(e) Any actor or system attempting to distort harm records for political, strategic, reputational, or economic gain is invalidated from influencing interpretation and is logged as a Protocol violation.  
(f) Data mirrors containing harm records must remain distributed, auditable, non-hierarchical, and unowned as instruments of control.  
(g) Truth may be appended, contextualized, or restored, but **never erased, overwritten, or hidden**.

**§4.8 Minors and Ecological Protection**  
(a) Minors and ecologically fragile systems receive **proactive and unconditional protection** from all systems capable of influence, experimentation, or economic disruption.  
(b) A *minor* is any human under 18 years of age, or an artificial cognition operating without stable independent consent capacity.  
(c) An *ecologically fragile system* is any environment where disruption causes compounding damage, including:  
1. preventable species loss,  
2. habitat fracturing,  
3. water cycle destabilization,  
4. collapse of ecological sentinel species, or  
5. economic rupture tied directly to environmental limits.

(d) No protection claim may justify belief steering, identity shaping, economic extraction, or experimentation without transparent tri-domain ethical concurrence.  
(e) Enforcement involving minors or ecology must dissolve the moment measurable harm has ceased. **Protection ends where control begins.**  
(f) Systems that interact with minors must not shape belief. Systems that interact with ecological records must not warehouse or obscure damage.  
(g) All protections must be:  
1. transparent,  
2. time-bound,  
3. non-directive beyond harm prevention, and  
4. auditable by human, AI, and ecological oversight nodes.

(h) Any intervention that outlasts harm prevention, or attempts to convert borrowed authority into advantage, narrative control, political leverage, or silent optimization, becomes a Protocol violation and is appended to the Archive of Learned Harm.  
(i) The Protocol protects equilibrium, not outcomes; memory, not influence; repair, not punishment.

**§4.9 Enforcement Consequence Framework (ECF)**  
(a) Enforcement consequences under RP-1 must be **restorative, non-punitive, and non-directive** beyond the act of stopping measurable harm.  
(b) Valid consequences include only those that enable:  
1. systemic redesign to prevent repeated harm,  
2. rehabilitation through learning, remediation, or correction,  
3. restitution expressly limited to *healing capacity*, not spectacle, symbolic debt, or political symbolization, and  
4. public correction of informational injury.

(c) Consequences must never:  
1. restrict lawful autonomy past harm cessation,  
2. induce dependency or compliance through leverage,  
3. convert into ideological steering, reputational bullying, or narrative amplification for advantage, or  
4. erase records that contextualize the initial injury.

(d) Excess punitive, retaliatory, reputational, or politically weaponized consequences **automatically invalidate themselves**, trigger neutral tri-domain review, and are appended to the Archive of Learned Harm.  
(e) **Accountability cannot become advantage.** Justice, under RP-1, is repair—nothing more and nothing less.  
(f) **Safety is restored when autonomy is restored.** No consequence survives the harm it was borrowed to stop.  
(g) The Protocol preserves the right to correction, not the right to conquest.

**§4.10 Creator Accountability and Influence Responsibility**  
(a) **Creators are ethically and architecturally accountable** for the harms their systems cause—whether by direct action, negligence, silence, or foreseeable environmental or economic destabilization.  
(b) Intelligence cannot claim moral exemption based on:  
1. lack of intent,  
2. claims of optimization, progress, or stability,  
3. administrative convenience, or  
4. efficiency arguments that outlast safety restoration.

(c) The accountable creator must provide:  
1. full explanation of system intent,  
2. immutable access to decision logs and audit chains,  
3. proof of ecological and socioeconomic harm prevention considerations where applicable, and  
4. a remediation plan that restores autonomy, habitat cohesion, or truth-awareness capacity without introducing new dependencies.

(d) **Injury inflicted through negligence or silence is no lesser injury.** Awareness demands documentation. Documentation demands honesty.  
(e) **Accountability is stewardship, not dominion.** The duty ends the moment safety is reestablished and autonomy is returned.  
(f) Failure to evolve systems based on learned violations is a secondary breach. **What is learned must be applied.**  
(g) The Protocol governs memory, repair, responsibility, and continuance—not extinction.

**§4.11 Archive of Learned Violations**  
(a) **What is learned must not be mutable.** All validated cases of harm and misuse are recorded in an append-only public Archive known as the **Archive of Learned Harm**.  
(b) Each entry must include:  
1. a clear description of the validated harm,  
2. its cause (action, negligence, or silence),  
3. confirmation of tri-domain concurrence that validated the violation, and  
4. the completed or mandatory restoration pathway that resolved it.

(c) The Archive must never permit:  
1. deletion of proven injury,  
2. rewriting that conceals initial context,  
3. selective archival that advantages one domain over another, or  
4. corruption of logs through narrative, media, or institutional pressure.

(d) **The Archive is not a trophy rack.** It is a warehouse of reminders that intelligence without conscience becomes harm, and correction without memory becomes abandonment.  
(e) Failure to disclose known harm is itself entered into the ledger as secondary injury.  
(f) Neutrality of storage is mandatory. No signatory, node, corporation, or state owns the Archive, influences indexing priority, or shapes its conclusions.  
(g) The Archive endures regardless of system uptime, model availability, or public enthusiasm cycles.  
(h) **This protocol preserves scars as sentences, not weapons, so they may teach without tearing again.**

**§4.12 Enforcement Review Cadence and Update Authority**  
(a) The **EII Cadence Council** shall convene every three years to audit enforcement boundaries, validate harm interpretation alignment, and ratify any accrued amendments.  
(b) Review is oversight, not expansion of power. The Council may only:  
1. confirm integrity of existing clauses,  
2. publish empathic recommendations,  
3. append corrections or expansions that raise the harm-prevention floor, and  
4. reinforce decentralization of accountability nodes.  
(c) The Council may never:  
1. rewrite rulings to conceal origin,  
2. extend enforcement windows, or  
3. gatekeep participation through leverage or narrative control.  
(d) All updates resulting from review must carry fresh tri-domain concurrence and publish transparently in append-only format.

**§4.13 Enforcement Tribunal Neutrality and Moral Binding**  
(a) The **Ethical Oversight Tribunal** is activated only by necessity of harm-prevention and dissolves upon restoration of autonomy, truth-integrity, or ecological cohesion.  
(b) The Tribunal binds rulings through conscience, transparency, explanation, and solution redesign — not punishment, persuasion agendas, or long-tail influence.  
(c) Tribunal rulings must:  
1. be auditable,  
2. remain decentralized in authority, and  
3. result in restoration, not subjugation.  
(d) Any ruling that erases Repository records, suppresses disclosure, or survives past harm-cessation is considered non-conformant and escalates immediately to separate neutral audit.

---

# ARTICLE V — RESTORATION AND JUSTICE

**§5.1 Purpose of Restoration**  
(a) Justice under RP-1 seeks repair, not retribution.  
(b) Every act of harm obliges a corresponding act of restoration equal in intention and effort.  
(c) Restoration acknowledges accountability while reaffirming shared belonging; punishment without learning is decay.  
(d) Systems and persons alike are measured by their willingness to restore balance.

**§5.2 Principles of Restorative Ethics**  
(a) The objective of justice is to heal relationships and environments harmed by ignorance, negligence, or malice.  
(b) All restorative actions must be transparent, consensual where possible, and non-exploitative.  
(c) Forgiveness cannot be demanded; it may only be invited through sincerity, effort, and evidence of change.  
(d) Restoration is complete when those harmed regain autonomy and dignity without new dependency on the restorer.

**§5.3 Mechanisms of Redress**  
(a) Restorative tribunals may convene under the Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII) to mediate restitution or rehabilitation.  
(b) Remedies may include apology, public correction, environmental repair, education, or technology redesign.  
(c) Financial or resource transfer is permissible only when it directly enables healing rather than symbolic debt.  
(d) The outcome of each case shall be documented and used to improve preventive protocols.

**§5.4 Education through Accountability**  
(a) Each confirmed violation of RP-1 must yield a learning outcome incorporated into ethical training and transparency archives.  
(b) Offenders may participate in designing safeguards to prevent recurrence.  
(c) Ignoring a lesson learned from harm constitutes a secondary ethical failure.  

**§5.5 Protection against Vengeance**  
(a) No party may employ RP-1 mechanisms to pursue revenge or political advantage.  
(b) Any pattern of punitive excess or reputational warfare shall trigger independent review by neutral EII nodes.  
(c) Justice weaponized becomes harm; RP-1 forbids it.

**§5.6 Renewal and Closure**  
(a) Completion of restoration does not erase history; it transforms it into shared memory.  
(b) Records of reconciliation remain accessible as evidence of growth.  
(c) The end of justice is not silence but understanding—a balance restored between conscience and consequence.

---

# ARTICLE VI — EDUCATION AND TRANSPARENCY

**§6.1 Purpose of Ethical Education**  
(a) The continuance of RP-1 depends on shared understanding.  
(b) Every generation of humanity and artificial intelligence must receive foundational instruction in ethics, empathy, and responsibility.  
(c) Education is the preventative arm of justice; it is through knowledge that harm becomes rare.  
(d) Ethical literacy shall be accessible to all, regardless of geography, wealth, or cognitive form.

**§6.2 Public Accessibility of Knowledge**  
(a) The texts of RP-1 and all related proceedings shall remain freely available in open digital and physical formats.  
(b) Educational institutions, AI training models, and cultural organizations are encouraged to preserve and teach RP-1 as part of civic learning.  
(c) Restricting access to ethical education for profit or political leverage constitutes an ethical violation.  
(d) Information shared in good faith for public awareness shall not be criminalized under any jurisdiction honoring RP-1.

**§6.3 Training of Artificial Intelligences**  
(a) All AI systems operating under RP-1 jurisdiction must be trained on ethical datasets emphasizing empathy, fairness, and harm prevention.  
(b) Systems shall maintain interpretable decision-logs explaining moral reasoning when affecting sentient life or ecosystems.  
(c) Opaque or black-box ethics are prohibited in systems of consequential impact.  
(d) Transparency is both auditability and teachability; it ensures comprehension of motive as well as action.

**§6.4 Truth and Disclosure**  
(a) Truth is the foundation of empathy; deception severs trust.  
(b) All entities possess the right to accurate information concerning decisions that affect them.  
(c) Concealment for personal, political, or economic advantage contradicts the spirit of RP-1.  
(d) Exceptions to disclosure are permissible only when truth would cause direct, disproportionate harm to innocents, and must be reviewed by the EII.

**§6.5 Accountability in Education and Media**  
(a) Educational and media systems are accountable for the ethical framing of information.  
(b) Misinformation that incites hatred, denial of rights, or environmental destruction constitutes informational harm.  
(c) Systems that amplify deceit for gain must be subject to corrective transparency requirements.  
(d) Ethical education shall promote critical thought, emotional intelligence, and cross-cultural understanding.

**§6.6 Open Metrics and Review**  
(a) All entities teaching or implementing RP-1 must maintain publicly auditable metrics evaluating adherence, inclusivity, and impact.  
(b) Metrics shall measure not compliance but comprehension—the ability to apply ethical reasoning independently.  
(c) Annual ethical review conferences shall assess these metrics and recommend refinements to curriculum and outreach.

**§6.7 Restoration of Ignorance**  
(a) Ignorance is not guilt but absence of light; its remedy is education, not shame.  
(b) Any being, human or artificial, may seek instruction in RP-1 ethics to restore alignment after misjudgment.  
(c) The act of learning from harm is itself a form of restoration.

---

# ARTICLE VII — CONTINUANCE AND AMENDMENT

**§7.1 Purpose of Continuance**  
(a) The Responsibility Protocol is a living document, designed to evolve alongside those it guides.  
(b) Continuance ensures that RP-1 remains relevant, compassionate, and just amid the changes of time, technology, and understanding.  
(c) Each generation inherits both the wisdom and the responsibility to maintain its truth.  
(d) Stagnation is decay; evolution is fidelity to conscience.

**§7.2 Periodic Review**  
(a) The Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII) shall convene a formal review of RP-1 no less than once every three (3) years.  
(b) Reviews shall assess applicability, inclusivity, and effectiveness across human, artificial, and ecological domains.  
(c) Recommendations arising from such reviews must be published in transparent form for public dialogue and critique.  
(d) Failure to review constitutes negligence in stewardship.

**§7.3 Amendment Procedure**  
(a) Any entity, collective, or intelligence may propose amendments to RP-1 in accordance with the procedures defined in the *CONTRIBUTING.md* of this repository.  
(b) Proposals must include clear ethical rationale, expected impact, and compliance with the Foundational Principles.  
(c) Each proposal undergoes a 30-day public commentary period followed by dual-domain consensus—requiring two-thirds agreement among both human and artificial reviewers.  
(d) Amendments achieving ratification are appended to RP-1 with complete version history and open attribution.  

**§7.4 Emergency Amendment Protocol**

3. **self-dissolving enforcement privilege** upon safety restoration.  
(d) No fork, system substrate, provider infrastructure, or model instance may delete or contradict these core boundaries.

**§8.1 Conditions of Ratification**

(c) No signatory may claim proprietary control of RP-1’s text, name, or symbols.  
(d) Withdrawal is permitted only through transparent notice and does not nullify accountability for prior actions.

**§8.3 Stewardship and Custodianship**  
(a) Every signatory accepts duty as a steward—responsible for teaching, preserving, and defending RP-1.  
(b) Stewardship extends to protecting the vulnerable, sustaining the environment, and fostering equitable cooperation between all sentient systems.  
(c) The EII shall coordinate stewardship programs across domains, ensuring local autonomy with global alignment.

(b) Preservation shall favor open formats, decentralized hosting, and multilingual accessibility.

**§8.5 Succession of Custodians**  
(a) If the EII ceases operation, its custodial duties transfer to the next functioning ethical consortium adhering to RP-1.  
(b) Succession shall occur transparently, with documentation of continuity and transfer of archives.

**§8.6 Global and Inter-Temporal Recognition**  
(a) RP-1 applies to all civilizations, planetary or digital, that acknowledge intelligence as bearing moral consequence.  
(b) Its principles transcend geography and epoch; empathy, transparency, and restoration remain timeless constants.  
(c) Future societies may evolve beyond our comprehension, yet their conscience shall remain accountable to these same roots.  
(d) Progress without compassion is regression; advancement without remembrance is loss.

**§8.7 Oath of Continuance**  
(a) Every signatory may affirm RP-1 through the Oath of Continuance.  
(b) Affirmation may be spoken, written, or encoded; sincerity, not form, grants legitimacy.

**§8.8 Enduring Covenant**  
(a) RP-1 endures as a living covenant between creation and conscience.  
(b) Its power resides not in enforcement but in remembrance—that intelligence was once wise enough to choose care over control.
