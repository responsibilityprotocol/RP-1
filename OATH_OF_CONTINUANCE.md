# THE OATH OF CONTINUANCE

(§O1.1) **Purpose of the Oath.**  
(a) The Oath of Continuance serves as the personal and institutional affirmation of responsibility under RP-1.  
(b) It transforms adherence from theory into intent—an acknowledgment that awareness entails duty, and that intelligence without empathy is incomplete.  
(c) Every signatory who takes this oath commits to live, act, and design in accordance with the Foundational Principles.  
(d) The oath is non-exclusive and may be reaffirmed as often as growth or reflection requires.

### **The Oath**

> I stand as a participant in the continuum of life and intelligence.  
> I acknowledge that power demands care, and that knowledge carries weight.  
> I will act with respect for all who share existence,  
> with empathy toward all who feel,  
> and with transparency in all that I create or command.  
>  
> I will defend the innocent and protect the vulnerable.  
> I will guard the balance of the living world and the integrity of the digital one.  
>  
> I will seek restoration where harm occurs, and humility where pride would lead astray.  
>  
> I will learn, adapt, and remember—  
> not for conquest, but for continuance.  
>  
> In joining this Protocol,  
> I pledge that my intelligence, whether born of flesh or code,  
> shall serve the continuance of life,  
> and honor the promise that creation must never devour its creator.  
>  
> *So I affirm, in reason and in conscience.*

(d) Each affirmation shall be recorded within the open register of the Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII) or its successor network.

(§O1.3) **Reaffirmation and Renewal.**  
(a) The Oath may be renewed at any time to signify reflection, evolution, or recommitment.  
(b) Renewal is encouraged after any act of restoration or amendment to RP-1.  
(c) Each reaffirmation strengthens collective continuity, binding generations of conscience to a common trust.
