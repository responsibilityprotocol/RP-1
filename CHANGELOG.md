## Version 1.0-draft – Addendum (April 2025 Update)

### Added
- **`RP-1_CONSTITUTION.md`** — Unified canonical Constitution merging Articles I–VIII with hybrid legal-philosophical tone.  
  - Incorporates full enforcement logic (EII), harm definitions, protections for minors and ecosystems.  
  - Establishes closing Declaration “The Long Continuance.”  
- Updated **`README.md`** and **`RP-1_INDEX.md`** to reference Constitution.  

### Summary
This update finalizes the *Constitutional Integration Phase* of RP-1.  
All prior article-level files remain modular for amendment tracking, while the new consolidated Constitution functions as the authoritative reference for ratification and archival purposes.

**Repository Version:** v1.0-draft

  - Due process and appeal rights for all entities under review
  - Public transparency, audit, and logging standards
