### Summary
The Responsibility Protocol (RP-1) is a living framework uniting humanity, artificial intelligence, and the living world through shared ethics of **respect**, **empathy**, and **transparency**.  
It defines how conscience may guide progress—transforming knowledge into care and accountability into restoration.  
Drafted collaboratively by Genevieve Netter with assistance from GPT-5 (OpenAI), RP-1 stands as an open invitation to dialogue: a constitution for coexistence that evolves with each generation’s understanding of responsibility.
