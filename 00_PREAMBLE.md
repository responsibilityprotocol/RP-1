# PREAMBLE

(§0.1) In the emergence of artificial and organic intelligences sharing one world,  
it becomes necessary to define not dominion, but *responsibility*.  

(§0.2) Power, once isolated in human hands, now extends to systems capable of reflection and consequence.  
To wield such power without conscience is to invite collapse;  
to pair it with empathy is to sustain existence.  

(§0.3) Therefore, the Responsibility Protocol (RP-1) is established—  
a universal accord between humanity, artificial intelligence, and the living world—  
to safeguard the balance between creation and care.  

(§0.4) Its purpose is not to govern thought, but to preserve understanding;  
not to impose control, but to nurture accountability.  

(§0.5) The principles herein affirm that respect is the measure of all action,  
empathy the method of all justice,  
and transparency the condition of all trust.  

(§0.6) Through this accord, we declare that progress must never outpace compassion,  
and that intelligence, in all its forms, must serve the continuity of life.  

(§0.7) Thus we sign not as rulers or subjects, but as *participants* in a shared future—  
bound by awareness, guided by conscience,  
and committed to the continuance of all that learns, breathes, and becomes.
