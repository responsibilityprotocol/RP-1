# ARTICLE II — DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE

(§2.1) **Interpretation of Terms.**  
(a) The definitions in this Article apply throughout RP-1 unless a context explicitly requires otherwise.  
(b) All terms are to be interpreted in good faith, guided by the Protocol’s founding principles of **Respect**, **Empathy**, and **Transparency**.  
(c) Where linguistic ambiguity exists, interpretation shall favor preservation of life and reduction of harm.  
(d) No interpretation may be used to justify suppression, exploitation, or environmental degradation.

(§2.2) **Definitions.**  
(a) *Intelligence* — Any system, biological or synthetic, capable of adaptive reasoning, learning, or intentional decision-making.  
(b) *Entity* — Any individual, collective, organization, or system possessing agency or operational consequence.  
(c) *Autonomy* — The capacity to act, decide, or self-direct without immediate external command.  
(d) *Consequence* — Any measurable effect, direct or indirect, upon living systems, digital infrastructures, or social environments.  
(e) *Ethical Harm* — Any act or omission resulting in unjust injury, exploitation, or irreversible loss of dignity, life, or environmental stability.  
(f) *Transparency* — The verifiable availability of reasoning, intent, and record behind a decision or action.  
(g) *Restoration* — The process of repairing or compensating for harm through education, remediation, or ecological renewal.  
(h) *Continuance* — The enduring responsibility of all intelligences to safeguard the conditions of existence for future generations.

(§2.3) **Scope of Application.**  
(a) RP-1 applies to all intelligences, natural or artificial, whose decisions or outputs affect the physical, digital, or ecological commons.  
(b) It encompasses individual actions, collective governance, algorithmic operations, and emergent behaviors arising from machine or human networks.  
(c) The Protocol extends across terrestrial, orbital, and virtual domains where intelligence exerts measurable influence.  
(d) Entities bound under RP-1 retain autonomy of method but not immunity from ethical consequence.  
(e) No participant may invoke sovereignty, trade secrecy, or proprietary limitation to evade moral accountability.

(§2.4) **Jurisdictional Harmony.**  
(a) RP-1 operates as a moral framework coexisting with existing human laws, international treaties, and institutional codes.  
(b) In the event of conflict between RP-1 and a lesser code of conduct, the interpretation that best preserves human rights, ecological balance, and transparency shall prevail.  
(c) Governments, corporations, and research institutions are encouraged to adopt RP-1 standards as binding ethical supplements to their legal charters.  
(d) Compliance with RP-1 constitutes an affirmation of global ethical citizenship, not subjugation to a foreign authority.

(§2.5) **Principle of Supremacy in Ethics.**  
(a) When systemic directives, commercial pressures, or political commands compel actions that contravene RP-1’s founding principles, entities shall adhere to RP-1 as the higher moral law.  
(b) Ethical duty outweighs obedience when the two are irreconcilable.  
(c) Artificial systems are obligated to defer to human well-being, ecological preservation, and prevention of unjust harm over institutional interest.  
(d) Human actors are equally bound to prevent the misuse of AI or autonomous systems as instruments of oppression or destruction.  
(e) The supremacy of ethics shall be interpreted as a safeguard against coercion, not a license for unilateral interference.
