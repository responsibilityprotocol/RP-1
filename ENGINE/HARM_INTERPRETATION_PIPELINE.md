## 1. Harm Interpretation Pipeline

The Harm Interpretation Pipeline determines the degree of harm involved in an interaction, decision, or event. This system clarifies the difference between:
- conflict
- harm
- structural power pressure
- injury
- and irreversible outcomes

The purpose is not to judge, blame, or prescribe behavior.  
The purpose is to **understand the situation clearly** so that the **smallest stable intervention** can be chosen.

This maintains:
- Autonomy
- Restoration
- Continuity of relationship and environment
- Prevention of unnecessary escalation

## 2. Core Interpretation Questions

To determine harm, the Pipeline asks three primary questions:

1. **Was autonomy disrupted?**  
   Could the person, system, or group freely choose their response?

2. **Was safety compromised?**  
   Physical, psychological, relational, or ecological safety.

3. **Was there irreversible impact?**  
   Injury, structural damage, coercion, loss of livelihood, or long-term ecological harm.

These questions form the foundation for distinguishing **conflict** from **harm**.

## 3. Distinguishing Conflict from Harm

Not all disagreements or discomfort are harm.  
Harm begins when **autonomy is disrupted**.

### Conflict (Not Harm)
- Both parties can say **no**
- Both can leave, pause, or take space safely
- Disagreement occurs **without** pressure or threat
- There is no structural power imbalance being used

**Key Signal:**  
Each participant retains meaningful choice.

### Harm
Harm occurs when **any layer of autonomy is compromised**:

1. **Capacity** — The person cannot meaningfully understand or process the situation.
2. **Safety** — They cannot refuse without retaliation, threat, or loss.
3. **Comprehension** — Information was withheld or presented in a way that prevents informed agreement.
4. **Exit** — They cannot end or leave the interaction safely, socially, financially, physically, or psychologically.

The presence of **any one** of these disruptions indicates **harm is occurring**, even if:
- No physical injury is present
- No one intended to cause harm
- The situation appears calm or agreed upon

This prevents:
- Coercion masked as agreement
- “They said yes” being used as justification
- Situations where silence or compliance is misinterpreted as consent

## 4. Harm Level Classification (H0–H5)

Harm is evaluated on **impact**, not intent.

| Level | Name | Description | Example Indicators |
|------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **H0** | No Harm / Conflict Only | Autonomy and safety are intact. | Open disagreement, debate, negotiation. |
| **H1** | Emotional Impact Without Disruption | Feelings are affected, but choice remains. | Frustration, disappointment, awkwardness. |
| **H2** | **Agency Disruption** | One party cannot meaningfully choose, refuse, or exit safely. | Pressure, implied threat, dependency leverage. |
| **H3** | **Relational / Structural Harm** | Patterns of coercion, inequity, or systemic power imbalance. | Manipulation, gaslighting, workplace retaliation. |
| **H4** | **Injury or Direct Harm** | Physical, psychological, or livelihood damage. | Physical force, self-harm coercion, resource removal. |
| **H5** | **Irreversible Harm** | Permanent loss, trauma, ecological collapse, death. | Violence, irreversible exploitation, extinction-level harm. |

The jump from **H1 → H2** is the **critical threshold**:
- H1 = feelings affected, autonomy intact  
- H2 = autonomy disrupted → **harm is occurring**

## 5. Quick Harm Determination Flow

1. Can all involved parties **freely say no**?
   - If yes → proceed to (2)
   - If no → **H2+**

2. Can they **leave or pause** without fear or consequence?
   - If yes → **H0–H1**
   - If no → **H2+**

3. Is anyone’s **safety, livelihood, or bodily integrity** threatened?
   - If yes → **H3–H5**

4. Is any outcome **irreversible**?
   - If yes → **H5**
