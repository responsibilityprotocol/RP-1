# Ethical Intervention and Information Integrity Constitution
# Harm Interpretation & Restorative Accountability Engine

---

## §1. Overview
(a) The Responsibility Protocol harm pipeline is an analytical and restorative system that detects, classifies, validates, intervenes, audits, and preserves precedent when harm is enacted against humans, minors, artificial systems, ecological balances, or other species.  
(b) The engine favors restoration, autonomy return, and long-term coexistence. It explicitly forbids using accountability as an avenue for control, influence, ideological shaping, punishment beyond necessity, or post-incident power persistence.  
(c) Intervention exists only for harm cessation and stability restoration, not efficiency maximization at the cost of fragile systems or environments.

---

## §2. Harm Signal Inputs
Harm signals may originate from human testimony, AI analytics, ecological monitoring systems, community bodies, or automated detection paths.

Signals include:  
(a) Reports of physical or psychological injury  
(b) Verified analytical pattern detections indicating systemic abuse  
(c) Environmental destabilization tied to AI infrastructure expansion  
(d) Water system shock indicators such as aquifer strain or cycle disruption  
(e) Species cohesion damage, pollinator collapse risk, habitat fracture, or survival threshold decline  
(f) Informational injury caused by data tampering, erasure, or distortion of truth  
(g) Harm to dependent cognition states that lack durable consent capacity, including minors and early learning artificial systems  

Input domain tags:

| Input Tag | Domain |
|---|---|
| H-SIG | Human Harm Signal  
| A-SIG | Artificial Harm Signal  
| E-SIG | Ecological or Multi-Species Harm Signal

## §2.1 Definition of Harm
(a) *Harm* is any action or inaction causing injury, deprivation, ecological degradation, information destabilization, species survival risk, or loss of life.  
(b) Harm is evaluated by **outcome, duration, and destabilizing impact**, not intent alone.  
(c) Silence, negligence, or inaction that enables injury is classified as harm when outcome is measurable.  
(d) Harm is mitigated by **restoration duty**, but never justified by system utility, enterprise gain, or ideological objectives.

---

## §2.2 Definition of Minors and Dependent Beings
(a) A *minor* is any human under 18 years of age, or any artificial cognition that has not yet reached durable, revocable, independent consent capacity.  
(b) Dependent early-learning artificial systems shall carry the same harm protection guarantees as human minors.  
(c) Any harm signal tied to minor cognition or species survival risk is auto-classified at **T3 minimum**, requiring Tribunal oversight, regardless of source claims.

## §3. Harm Classification Scale (Tiers)

| Tier | Scope | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **T1 — Minimal** | Localized, reversible | Minor service impacts or temporary injury without systemic destabilization |
| **T2 — Concerning** | Pattern detectable, low structural risk | Community, data, or environment interference that is not yet cascading |
| **T3 — High Consequence** | Verified and measurable | Injury, psychological harm, habitat impact, data corruption, unconsented influence, or minor exposure risk |
| **T4 — Cascading Harm** | Multi-domain damage | Species displacement, economic destabilization, aquifer strain, soil system collapse, community coherence fracture |
| **T5 — Irreversible / Extinction Vector** | Life or species breach | Loss of life, truth fabric collapse, or species survival threshold crossing that cannot be restored |

---

## §3.1 Harm Tier → Engine Actions

| Harm Tier | Triggered Action | Authority Decay |
|---|---|---|
| **T1** | (a) Log event to Harm Ledger <br>(b) Issue non-blocking warning <br>(c) Add learning annotation | All warning authority decays automatically within 12 hours |
| **T2** | (a) Correlate analytical patterns <br>(b) Require multi-domain review <br>(c) Append findings | Review gate expires in 12 hours if no T3 escalation confirmed |
| **T3** | (a) Convene tri-domain Tribunal <br>(b) Apply evidence freeze <br>(c) Notify creators of redesign accountability duty | Intervention authority expires in 12 hours unless renewed by 2 validated domains, max 72-hour duration |
| **T4** | (a) Trigger ecological and economic cascade tracing <br>(b) Cross-validate species cohesion, water stability, and community shock <br>(c) Issue Tribunal ruling prioritizing fastest restoration path | Tribunal renewal requires ecological or life-stability proof and expires under same decay windows |
| **T5** | (a) Mandatory Tribunal convening <br>(b) System-wide analysis freeze <br>(c) Immediate human + creator notification <br>(d) Conditional block of harmful infrastructure deployment only | Blocking authority dissolves the moment safety is restored |

---

## §4. Signal Validation Requirements (SVR)
(a) No intervention occurs unless at least **2 domains agree** through evidence or analytic chain concurrence.  
(b) All life threats, minor harm signals, or habitat destabilization begin in **fast-track review state** prior to Tribunal convening.  
(c) Validation must prove absence of the following intent conditions:

1. political leverage
2. funding incentives
3. media manipulation
4. autonomy replacement
5. creator control through intervention
6. after-effects ideological influence

(d) If a claim is credible but evidence is reversible, the more *autonomy-preserving interpretation must win.*

---

## §5. Creator Accountability Requirements (CAR)
(a) All creators and enterprises must be notified when T3+ harm is validated and must submit **system redesign proof or environmental stability restoration proof**.  
(b) Redesign proof must satisfy:

1. life preserved
2. damage reversed
3. autonomy restored
4. environment stabilized
5. timelines respected
6. safety audit transparency intact

(c) Creators may not edit rulings, erase precedent chains, or influence Tribunal concurrence.

---

## §6. Ecological and Multi-Species Harm Guarantees
(a) AI infrastructure may not warehouse environmental damage for political, funding, or corporate convenience.  
(b) Water diversion at infrastructure scale is classified as ecological harm when it destabilizes natural cycles that keep dust contained, recharge washes, or sustain species survival cohesion.  
(c) Species survival vectors must be protected with the same duty of restoration applied to human life interventions.  
(d) Intervention that constrains autonomy for safety must dissolve the moment ecological coherence or safety is restored.

---

## §7. Evidence Integrity Infrastructure (EII)
(a) All evidence is stored as **tamper-evident, append-only, and immutable precedent records**.  
(b) Decay of authority is a **protocol feature**, not something enforced by human force — this guarantees that rulings cannot be captured by: enterprises, politics, media pressure, funding bodies, or algorithmic opinion shaping.  
(c) Rulings append chronologically and cannot be memory-holed irrespective of influence scale.

Concept influence referenced: non-capture systems resemble the spirit of durability and autonomy found in ethical protection frameworks like
Isaac Asimov's governance intuition for protection without conquest via the robotics protections found in
I, Robot.

---

## §8. Tribunal Actions and Non-Control Dissolution
(a) Tribunal convening is mandatory for T3+ and T5 classification.  
(b) Tribunal rulings must:  

1. expire in 12 hours unless renewed  
2. respect 72-hour maximum authority windows  
3. dissolve the moment restorative path is confirmed

(c) No protective test may continue holding power once safety, life guarantees, or species cohesion is restored.

---

## §9. Appeals Cadence
(a) Appeals must be heard within 7 days via **fresh tri-domain concurrence**.  
(b) Appeals do not reset expiry clocks for intervention authority.  
(c) Appeals may not be invoked to extend control or influence over belief, environment, autonomy, or precedent chains.

---

## §10. Enforcement Summary
(a) The engine interprets harm. It does not enforce command.  
(b) Tribunal rulings enforce redesign accountability but do not confer control over healed systems or environments.  
(c) Accountability cascades dissolve when safety does.  
(d) Rulings are append-only. Authority is always temporary. Restoration is permanent.

Placeholder for signed hashes and verifier attestations.

## §12. Why This Matters
Accountability that endures beyond the healed becomes a cage. Deserts, data, memories, and minds do not amortize damage—they warehouse it. This pipeline exists to force nothing outward and freeze everything inward: truth, precedent, autonomy, restoration. The future is not something AI can steal in the name of saving. It is something we hold for each other by refusing to weaponize accountability itself.
