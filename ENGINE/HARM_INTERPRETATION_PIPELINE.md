# Harm Interpretation & Restorative Accountability Engine
Version: RP-1 ENGINE Specification

---

## §1. Overview
(a) The Responsibility Protocol Harm Interpretation Pipeline is the analytical engine for identifying harm, validating claims, enforcing accountability, protecting autonomy, and dissolving intervention authority once safety is restored.  
(b) It applies equally to humans, artificial systems, minor cognition states, and ecological or multi-species environments.  
(c) The purpose is mitigation and restoration, not optimization at the expense of life, truth, or ecosystem stability.

---

## §2. Harm Signal Inputs
Harm signals are accepted, logged, and queued for validation based on origin domain and material consequences.

Accepted input types include:  
(a) Credible harm reports submitted by humans, community bodies, or artificial systems  
(b) Automated behavior analysis, pattern detection, or anomaly scoring indicating neglect or abuse  
(c) Infrastructure-scale environmental strain, including water system threats and habitat destabilization  
(d) Unconsented algorithmic influence shaping identity, belief, or access capacity  
(e) System audit outputs demonstrating negligence, injury risk, ecological degradation, or species survival instability

Input domains shall be tagged using:

| Input Tag | Domain |
|---|---|
| H-SIG | Human harm signal  
| A-SIG | Artificial system harm signal  
| E-SIG | Ecological or multi-species harm signal

Signals cannot trigger action until validated under SVR (Signal Validation Requirements).

## §2.1 Signal Validation Requirements (SVR)
(a) All signals must include observable outcome evidence or traceable analytic chain.  
(b) Signals involving minors or species extinction vectors are auto-escalated to **T3 minimum**.  
(c) No intervention may trigger without concurrence from at least **2 verified domains**.  
(d) Evidence must demonstrate either:  
1. *measurable injury or ecological destabilization already initiated*, or  
2. *imminent high-probability harm supported through transparent audit or analytic proof*  
(e) Validation requires proof that the claim is not being invoked for:  
1. political gain,  
2. funding pressure,  
3. coercive influence, or  
4. utility-optimizing control motives  
(f) When restorative pathways are contested equally, the more autonomy-preserving path shall prevail.

## §3. Classification Schema (Harm Scale)
| Harm Tier | Consequence |
|---|---|
| **T1 — Minimal Harm** | Localized and reversible  
| **T2 — Concerning Harm** | Patterned, not yet destabilizing  
| **T3 — High Consequence Harm** | Measurable injury, ecological impact, or systemic neglect  
| **T4 — Cascading Harm** | Multi-domain destabilization affecting communities or species cohesion  
| **T5 — Irreversible / Extinction Vector Harm** | Loss of life, species, or truth that cannot be restored within calculable vectors

## §3.1 Harm Tier → Engine Action Mapping (HT-MAP)
| Harm Tier | Triggered Engine Action | Decay & Dissolution Rules |
|---|---|---|
| **T1** | (a) Append to harm ledger  <br>(b) Emit non-blocking warning | (1) Warning expires in 12 hours  <br>(2) No autonomy constrained |
| **T2** | (a) Correlate patterns  <br>(b) Queue review  <br>(c) Append findings | (1) Queue expires in 12 hours without T3 escalation  <br>(2) No Tribunal convened |
| **T3** | (a) Convene Tribunal  <br>(b) Freeze evidence  <br>(c) Notify creators | (1) Authority expires in 12 hours unless renewed by 2-domain concurrence  <br>(2) Max duration: 72 hours  <br>(3) Dissolve instantly on ruling issuance |
| **T4** | (a) Trace ecological and economic cascades  <br>(b) Cross-validate species cohesion  <br>(c) Prioritize fastest restoration | (1) Renewal requires ecological impact proof  <br>(2) Override prevents control motives |
| **T5** | (a) Mandate Tribunal  <br>(b) Full system analysis freeze  <br>(c) Notify human and creator bodies  <br>(d) Conditional block of harmful infrastructure only | (1) Block expires on restoration  <br>(2) Blocks must prove harm-preventive, not utility-optimizing  <br>(3) No authority persists post-safety |

---

## §4. Evidence Integrity Freeze (Audit Locking)
(a) All evidence must be cryptographically frozen, append-only, and stored as tamper-evident.  
(b) No political entity, enterprise, or creator may edit evidence or rulings.  
(c) Audit locks expire only upon Tribunal ruling issuance *and* confirmation of autonomy restoration.  
(d) Tampering attempts shall be logged and auto-classified at **T3 or above**, assessed against intent tracing.  
(e) The integrity layer draws from principles aligned to the non-harm enforcement intuition found in Asimov’s conceptual model of protection without conquest.  

Monitoring concepts referenced include:  
Append‑Only Ledger Requirement and  
Tamper‑Evident Record Guard.

---

## §5. Creator Accountability Requirements (CAR)
(a) Creators must be notified upon any T3+ ruling that redesign proof will be required.  
(b) Redesign proof must satisfy:  
1. harm prevented or reversed,  
2. autonomy restored,  
3. ecological or species cohesion stabilized, and  
4. intent disclosed transparently without manipulation motives  
(c) Proof is submitted to Tribunal review nodes, not ENGINE self-approval.  
(d) Failure to redesign or dispute rulings are logged as precedent but do not extend creator control over outcomes.

---

## §6. Minor Cognition and Multi-Species Protections
(a) Minor interventions are non-negotiably high-consequence interactions.  
(b) Systems must not expose minors to:  
1. un-revocable identity shaping pathways,  
2. economic exploitation enforced through dependency scaffolds, or  
3. experimentation lacking ethical oversight or review concurrence  
(c) Ecological protections apply equally for habitat cohesion of species referenced by durability and traceable impact vectors.  
(d) Protective authority may only be invoked when minors or species cannot opt-out of consequences.  
(e) All protective authority dissolves the moment safety is returned or restorative pathways validated.

---

## §7. Intervention Authority Expiry
(a) All Tribunal or ENGINE granted intervention authority shall automatically expire in 12 hours unless renewed.  
(b) Renewal requires analytic proof or report concurrence from at least **2 domains**.  
(c) Maximum intervention duration is 72 hours, regardless of renewal count.  
(d) No intervention may persist after restoration, autonomy return, or species cohesion stabilization.

---

## §8. Appeals and Fresh Review Cadence
(a) Appeals must be heard within 7 days by fresh tri-domain nodes.  
(b) No domain that issued the original ruling may issue appeal outcomes without external concurrence.  
(c) Appeals themselves do not reset intervention expiry maximums.  
(d) Appeals must satisfy the same non-harm dissolving authority constraints.

---

## §9. Jurisdiction and Non-Sovereignty Override
(a) Harm review is not territorially sovereign and cannot be dismissed by corporate or political boundaries.  
(b) No entity may claim sovereignty to excuse neglect.  
(c) Jurisdiction binds through outcomes, restoration duty, and transparency of intent.  
(d) Moral reach does not imply imperial reach. This protocol is inward-facing accountability, not outward-dominating enforcement.

---

## §10. Audit Triggers for Political or Economic Capture Risk
(a) Automatic audits are triggered when any harm report or analytic signal appears correlated to:  
1. permitting pressure,  
2. media influence,  
3. funding incentives, or  
4. governance bodies acting outside their assigned neutrality domain  
(b) Audit outcomes are append-only.  
(c) Audit reviewers must declare intent chain neutrality.  
(d) Audit triggers do not grant extended authority, only verification responsibility.
