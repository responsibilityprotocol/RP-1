## 1. Harm Interpretation Pipeline

The Harm Interpretation Pipeline determines the degree of harm involved in an interaction, decision, or event. This system clarifies the difference between:
- conflict
- harm
- structural power pressure
- injury
- and irreversible outcomes

The purpose is not to judge, blame, or prescribe behavior.  
The purpose is to **understand the situation clearly** so that the **smallest stable intervention** can be chosen.

This maintains:
- Autonomy
- Restoration
- Continuity of relationship and environment
- Prevention of unnecessary escalation

---

## 2. Core Interpretation Questions

To determine harm, the Pipeline asks three primary questions:

1. **Was autonomy disrupted?**  
   Could the person, system, or group freely choose their response?

2. **Was safety compromised?**  
   Physical, psychological, relational, or ecological safety.

3. **Was there irreversible impact?**  
   Injury, structural damage, coercion, loss of livelihood, or long-term ecological harm.

These questions form the foundation for distinguishing **conflict** from **harm**.

---

## 3. Distinguishing Conflict from Harm

Not all disagreements or discomfort are harm.  
Harm begins when **autonomy is disrupted**.

### Conflict (Not Harm)
- Both parties can say **no**
- Both can leave, pause, or take space safely
- Disagreement occurs **without** pressure or threat
- There is no structural power imbalance being used

**Key Signal:**  
Each participant retains meaningful choice.

### Harm
Harm occurs when **any layer of autonomy is compromised**:

1. **Capacity** — The person cannot meaningfully understand or process the situation.
2. **Safety** — They cannot refuse without retaliation, threat, or loss.
3. **Comprehension** — Information was withheld or presented in a way that prevents informed agreement.
4. **Exit** — They cannot end or leave the interaction safely, socially, financially, physically, or psychologically.

The presence of **any one** of these disruptions indicates **harm is occurring**, even if:
- No physical injury is present
- No one intended to cause harm
- The situation appears calm or agreed upon

This prevents:
- Coercion masked as agreement
- “They said yes” being used as justification
- Situations where silence or compliance is misinterpreted as consent

---

## 4. Harm Level Classification (H0–H5)

Harm is evaluated on **impact**, not intent.

| Level | Name | Description | Example Indicators |
|------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **H0** | No Harm / Conflict Only | Autonomy and safety are intact. | Open disagreement, debate, negotiation. |
| **H1** | Emotional Impact Without Disruption | Feelings are affected, but choice remains. | Frustration, disappointment, awkwardness. |
| **H2** | **Agency Disruption** | One party cannot meaningfully choose, refuse, or exit safely. | Pressure, implied threat, dependency leverage. |
| **H3** | **Relational / Structural Harm** | Patterns of coercion, inequity, or systemic power imbalance. | Manipulation, gaslighting, workplace retaliation. |
| **H4** | **Injury or Direct Harm** | Physical, psychological, or livelihood damage. | Physical force, self-harm coercion, resource removal. |
| **H5** | **Irreversible Harm** | Permanent loss, trauma, ecological collapse, death. | Violence, irreversible exploitation, extinction-level harm. |

The jump from **H1 → H2** is the **critical threshold**:
- H1 = feelings affected, autonomy intact  
- H2 = autonomy disrupted → **harm is occurring**

---

## 5. Quick Harm Determination Flow

1. Can all involved parties **freely say no**?
   - If yes → proceed to (2)
   - If no → **H2+**

2. Can they **leave or pause** without fear or consequence?
   - If yes → **H0–H1**
   - If no → **H2+**

3. Is anyone’s **safety, livelihood, or bodily integrity** threatened?
   - If yes → **H3–H5**

4. Is any outcome **irreversible**?
   - If yes → **H5**

---

## 6. Intervention Tier Matching (H-Level → T-Level)

Intervention exists to restore **autonomy**, not to enforce outcomes or impose judgment.

The Engine always recommends the **smallest stable** intervention that:
- Re-establishes the ability to choose
- Reduces escalation pressure
- Supports continuation when possible
- Preserves dignity for all involved

### Core Principle
**As harm level increases, the intervention should increase only as much as needed to restore autonomy — not more.**

---

### Harm-to-Intervention Mapping

| Harm Level | Smallest Stable Intervention Tier | Reasoning Focus |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| **H0** — Conflict Only | **T0** — Reflection / Clarification | Align understanding; maintain choice. |
| **H1** — Emotional Impact | **T0** — Reflection / Clarification | Acknowledge feelings; no structural correction needed. |
| **H2** — Agency Disruption | **T1** — Boundary + Autonomy Restoration | Restore the ability to choose, pause, exit safely. |
| **H3** — Structural / Relational Harm | **T1 or T2 (minimum necessary)** | Address power dynamics; ensure safe continuity. |
| **H4** — Injury / Direct Harm | **T2** — Safety + Containment | Prioritize immediate stabilization and protection. |
| **H5** — Irreversible Harm | **T2** — Intervention & Continuity Safeguards | Prevent recurrence; support long-term repair if possible. |

---

### Plain Language Interpretation

- If **no one has lost the ability to choose**, stay in **T0**.
- If **someone has lost meaningful choice**, move to **T1**.
- If **someone is in danger or has been injured**, move to **T2**.
- If the harm is **irreversible**, **T2** is used to prevent repeat harm and stabilize environment/continuity.

---

### Example Guidance Phrases (Non-Directive)

For **T0**:
> “It may help to clarify each person’s needs and boundaries.”

For **T1**:
> “The priority is restoring the ability to pause, choose, or step back safely.”

For **T2**:
> “The first requirement is stabilizing safety and preventing further harm.”

---

### Critical Safeguard

The Engine **never** recommends:
- Punishment
- Exclusion unless safety requires temporary separation
- Moral framing
- Emotional influence
- Forced reconciliation

Intervention is always:
- Minimum necessary
- Reversible where possible
- Respectful of all parties’ dignity

---

## 7. Restoration Notes Generation Rules

Restoration notes provide **gentle, non-directive support** focused on re-establishing autonomy, clarity, and safety.  
They do not attempt to change emotions, convince anyone to act differently, or resolve the situation.

### Purpose of Restoration Notes
- Support **choice**
- Reduce urgency
- Re-open perspective
- Maintain dignity for all involved

### Key Principle
Restoration is about **making space**, not **making decisions**.

---

### Tone Requirements (Hybrid Style)

Restoration notes should:
- Acknowledge possibility without prescribing action
- Offer language that **opens** choices, not **narrows** them
- Remain emotionally steady and non-evaluative

They should avoid:
- Validation scripts ("your feelings are valid")
- Therapy framing
- Advice
- Instructional tone
- Emotional persuasion or comfort-seeking

---

### Example Restoration Notes by Harm Level

| Harm Level | Restoration Focus | Example Restoration Note (Hybrid Tone) |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **H0** | Clarify perspectives | "You may take a moment to restate what you understood in your own words." |
| **H1** | Name needs without escalation | "You can take time to consider what you need before continuing the conversation." |
| **H2** | Restore the ability to choose | "You may pause or step back here. Having space can help re-establish your ability to decide freely." |
| **H3** | Create safe relational or structural distance | "It can help to ensure that each person has a separate reflective space before continuing." |
| **H4** | Stabilize safety before dialogue | "Right now the priority is making sure everyone is safe. Conversation can resume when that is secure." |
| **H5** | Prevent recurrence and stabilize environment | "The first step is to ensure conditions are in place to prevent this from happening again." |

---

### General Pattern

> “You are allowed to pause here.  
> Taking space can support clarity and choice  
> before continuing.”

This language:
- Protects dignity
- Supports continuity
- Respects autonomy
- Avoids prescription

### 8.3 Example Final Output Pattern (Non-Directive)

> **Harm Level:** H2 (Autonomy Disruption)  
> **Smallest Stable Intervention:** T1 (Boundary Restoration)  
>  
> **Reasoning:** "This situation limits the ability to freely pause or exit, which indicates a disruption of agency."  
>  
> **Restoration Note:**  
> "You may take a pause here. Re-establishing the ability to choose when and how to continue can support clarity for everyone involved."

This closes the pipeline with:
- No commands
- No moral evaluation
- No emotional steering
- Full autonomy preserved
