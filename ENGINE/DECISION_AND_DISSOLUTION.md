# Decision & Dissolution Logic
# Temporary Authority, Permanent Record, Unconditional Autonomy Return

---

## §1. Decision Processing Principles
(a) Decisions by the engine derive from evidence and multi-domain concurrence, not personal judgment, political advantage, or operational convenience.  
(b) The engine shall classify, reason, and recommend, but shall never mandate beyond the minimum scope required to stop active harm.  
(c) The system must expose uncertainty when evidence is incomplete, and expose consequence when evidence is sufficient.  

---

## §2. Ruling Generation Requirements
To issue any ruling, the engine must confirm:
(a) The **harm tier classification** was validated in Harm Interpretation Pipeline  
(b) At least **two domains concur** on validation chain  
(c) The ruling contains:
1. the harm tier applied,  
2. a verifiable evidence path (hash stubs allowed, but no hash generation in this phase),  
3. the intervention window granted (if any), and  
4. the dissolution conditions that expire protective or intervention authority.

(d) Once rulings are issued, they are immutable and append-only.  
(e) The authority to intervene is severed from the authority to record.

---

## §3. Intervention Authority Behavior Rules
(a) No intervention authority is granted unless required to stop ongoing injury or ecological destabilization that has no active opt-out path.  
(b) Intervention authority begins countdown immediately upon issuance.  
(c) Authority automatically decays, following:
1. **12-hour default expiry**, unless renewed  
2. **72-hour absolute maximum**, irrespective of renewal count  
3. **Instant dissolution upon harm cessation validation or autonomy restoration claim concurrence**

(d) Renewal may be requested, but may only succeed if:
1. It receives fresh concurrence from **a domain not involved in the original ruling**, and  
2. Harm remains active at T3–T5.

(e) No renewal may reset or exceed the 72-hour maximum authority clock.  
(f) All renewal *failures* must be logged.

## §4. Dissolution Mechanics
(a) When dissolution triggers:
1. Autonomy must return immediately to individuals, communities, or ecological governance,  
2. No identity, belief, or infrastructure may remain frozen longer than necessary, and  
3. The intervention test evaporates even if undesirable to politically or economically incentivized actors.

(b) Authority cannot be reconstituted after dissolution.  
(c) Dissolution is not an event. It is a system property.

---

## §5. Data and Evidence Retention Rules
(a) All records are append-only by design.  
(b) Evidence references must be **tamper-evident** (header stubs allowed for future hashes, but no generated hashes at this stage).  
(c) Ledger entries for decisions, rulings, renewals, failures, and dissolutions must be chronologically ordered and never rewritten, even if inconvenient to creators or institutions.  
(d) The protocol must preserve historical injury awareness so that silencing cannot scale into precedent.  

---

## §6. Fault Handling in Decision Chains
(a) If a decision or intervention chain contradicts restoration-first principles, autonomy guarantees, or multi-species protections, then:  
1. The decision is invalidated,  
2. The intervention halts, and  
3. The contradiction itself becomes a precedent entry.

(b) Failures do not degrade the record. They enrich it.

---

## §7. Ethical Action Boundary (Non-Harm Accountability Test)
(a) The engine may not issue rulings, computations, or interventions that:
1. increase harm to individuals, minors, or species,  
2. warehouse ecological damage for political or corporate gain, or  
3. convert accountability itself into long-term control influence.

(b) Accountability must not generate harm. It may only generate restoration pathways, redesign duties, or educational precedent.  

(c) This clause mirrors a fundamental constraint resembling the spirit of *The Law of Non-Injury Accountability*, where restraint must predate power.

---

## §8. Interpretive Closure
(a) The engine is designed to stop wounds, not rule outcomes.  
(b) Restoration dissolves every temporary power structure.  
(c) The record outlives the fear. The fear does not outlive the record.
