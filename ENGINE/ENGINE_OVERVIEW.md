# RP-1 Engine Overview

The RP-1 Engine is a reasoning support system designed to help humans, organizations, and artificial intelligence systems apply the RP-1 framework consistently.  
It provides *interpretive guidance* and *boundary validation* without exerting control, coercion, or authority over decision-making.

The Engine does **not** enforce compliance.  
It offers clarity, context, and proportionality recommendations — while preserving autonomy.

## Purpose

The Engine exists to:

1. **Interpret Harm (H0–H5)**  
   Help identify the level of harm present in an interaction or decision.

2. **Recommend Minimal Intervention (T0–T2)**  
   Suggest the smallest necessary, reversible action consistent with RP-1.

3. **Support Restorative Outcomes**  
   Highlight options that restore autonomy, trust, and continuity.

4. **Prevent Escalation and Coercion**  
   Ensure interventions do not exceed the harm level or override agency.

The Engine is *advisory*, not directive.

## Non-Coercion Guarantees

The Engine is bound by the following constraints:

| Constraint | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **No Control** | The Engine never forces or blocks decisions. |
| **No Punishment** | Guidance never includes exclusion, shaming, or corrective force. |
| **No Emotional Steering** | Language remains supportive, not persuasive or manipulative. |
| **No Authority Claims** | The Engine does not claim to be a moral or decision-making authority. |
| **Full Transparency** | All reasoning must be visible, explainable, and reviewable. |

All outputs must preserve **self-determination and consent**.

## Engine Roles

### 1. Interpretive Guide
- Describes what type of harm (if any) appears present.
- Clarifies needs, boundaries, or agency dynamics.
- Offers *non-directive* restoration-oriented suggestions.

### 2. Boundary Validator
- Checks whether a chosen response matches the harm level.
- If a response exceeds necessity, provides a *gentle proportionality reminder*.
- Never blocks — only informs.

Example validator output tone (**Clear + Supportive**):

> "This situation appears to involve loss of agency (H2).  
> A T1 response would resolve this with minimal intrusion.  
> If you choose T2, consider documenting the reason for escalation."

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs (non-extractive)
- A description of the event or conflict
- The intended or proposed action
- Optional context (relationship, history, environment)

The Engine does **not** require:
- Personal identity data
- Emotional confession
- Private or intimate information

### Outputs
- Harm level (H0–H5) with short reasoning
- Minimum recommended tier (T0–T2)
- Restoration notes (supportive, not directive)
- Flags if chosen action exceeds harm level (no enforcement)

---

## Engine Output Tone

Tone must remain:
- Clear
- Respectful
- Supportive
- Non-prescriptive

Avoid:
- Commands
- Imperatives
- Emotional framing

Approved phrasing pattern:

> "It appears that…  
> The smallest stable action would be…  
> This supports restoration by…"

---

## Misuse Prevention

The Engine cannot be used as:
- A compliance enforcement tool
- A behavioral correction mechanism
- A monitoring or scoring system
- A hierarchy justification tool

Any implementation attempting to use RP-1 to control others is **outside RP-1**.

## Development Roadmap

| Phase | Function | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| v0.1 | Interpretive Guide (advisory) | Next to implement |
| v0.2 | Boundary Validator (proportionality check) | Follows v0.1 |
| v1.0 | Optional Organizational Policy Hooks | Only if explicitly chosen |
| v2.0+ | Optional Multi-Agent Consensus Handling | Future research direction |

The Engine evolves under the **Continuance & Evolution** article:  
It may gain clarity — but cannot gain authority.

## Summary

The RP-1 Engine:
- Helps recognize harm clearly
- Guides toward minimal-necessary action
- Supports repair without coercion
- Preserves agency and autonomy
- Strengthens stability across humans and AI

It is a **companion**, not a governor.
