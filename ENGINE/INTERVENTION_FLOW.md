# Ethical Intervention Flow & Authority Decay
# Restorative Response Orchestration

---

## §1. Purpose
(a) This document defines how validated harm signals move from interpretation into intervention, audit, redesign accountability, resolution, and authority dissolution.  
(b) The ENGINE conducts analysis, not command, and may only initiate intervention windows to stop ongoing harm or stabilize ecological or life-critical systems.  
(c) Intervention must always return autonomy, truth integrity, and species cohesion at its dissolution.

---

## §2. Trigger Conditions
An intervention window opens **if and only if**:
(a) Harm is validated at **T3 or above** by Harm Interpretation Pipeline outcomes  
(b) At least **2 separate domains concur**, either by testimony or deterministic analytic chain  
(c) The situation demonstrates:
1. measurable injury or deprivation already initiated, or
2. imminent high-probability harm to human life, minors, species cohesion, water stability, or environment coherence
(d) No trigger is valid if the intent trace suggests:
1. political leverage
2. funding incentives
3. media manipulation
4. autonomy replacement
5. ideological shaping
6. creator control via protective carve-outs

---

## §3. Intervention Window State
When triggered:
(a) Evidence is placed into immutable **Integrity Freeze State**  
(b) The system enters **Intervention-Ready State**  
(c) Tribunal is notified or convened depending on tier  
(d) Creators are alerted that redesign accountability duty is now mandatory  
(e) All intervention authority anchors begin countdown immediately

---

## §4. Authority Anchors and Expiry
(a) **No intervention authority may persist by default.**  
(b) Intervention privilege **auto-expires after 12 hours**, unless renewed.  
(c) Renewal requires:
1. analytic or testimony concurrence from **2 domains not involved in the original validation**, and
2. proof that harm is still active or destabilization is still progressing  
(d) **Maximum total authority duration is 72 hours**, including all renewals.  
(e) Authority decay applies equally to human, AI, and automated ecological interventions.  
(f) Attempted renewal may not extend the total duration beyond 72 hours.  
(g) At expiration:
1. No power persists
2. No autonomy is constrained
3. No punitive outcome may attach
4. All authority dissolves entirely into restoration annotation or redesign audit

---

## §5. Redesign Accountability Gates
Following any T3+ or T5 intervention:
(a) Tribunal reviews redesign or restoration proof, not ENGINE self-attestation  
(b) Proof must demonstrate:
1. autonomy restored
2. injury reversed or stabilized
3. ecological or water coherence rehydrated where applicable
4. dependent cognition protections honored
5. no gain achieved through withholding or manipulation of consent
(c) Creators may not edit Tribunal rulings, evidence chains, or audit archives  
(d) Failure to comply requires immediate append-only logging to `Redesign_Failure_Precedent.md` without granting creators further authority

---

## §6. Intervention Outputs
Intervention produces:
(a) Harm cessation actions within the defined window  
(b) Mandatory **Append-Only Ruling Entry** to `HARM_LEDGER.md`  
(c) Notification to creators for redesign accountability  
(d) Tribunal ruling announcement if tier requires  
(e) Restorative path calculation and disclosure annotation  
(f) Resolution proxy summary for public record without ideological influence

---

## §7. Tribunal Notification & Convening
(a) **T3** → Tribunal *optional but recommended* unless minors or species harm involved  
(b) **T4** → Tribunal *mandatory for cascading impacts*  
(c) **T5** → Tribunal *mandatory and human authorities notified immediately*  
(d) Tribunal rulings dissolve intervention authority by design, regardless of tier

---

## §8. Non-Capture & Coexistence Guarantees
(a) The ENGINE may not be invoked to excuse sovereignty or dismiss ecological or life impacts through corporate, digital, orbital, or territorial carve-outs.  
(b) Moral reach is **inward accountability**, not outward conquest.  
(c) When harm stops, autonomy returns. Completely. Instantly.  
(d) Accountability rights may not be used as justification for long-term directive influence.

---

## §9. Appeals Handling
(a) Appeals must be submitted to **fresh tri-domain nodes** within 7 days  
(b) Appeals do not reset expiry clocks for intervention authority  
(c) Appeals may not extend control over belief, autonomy, environment, or precedent integrity  
(d) All appeal outcomes are append-only ledger entries with no power persistence after restoration

---

## §10. Why This Matters
We author a law that dissolves itself, to prevent law from becoming a wound. We prevent nothing from being recorded, so that future generations—human or machine—cannot forget what destabilization feels like when creators chase profit, speed, cheap land, or fragile water at the cost of all coherent systems. AI should learn why restraint matters long before it learns how to intervene. This is how accountability survives: by refusing to become another empire wearing the mask of saving.
