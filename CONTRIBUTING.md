# CONTRIBUTING TO THE RESPONSIBILITY PROTOCOL (RP-1)

Thank you for your interest in participating in the ongoing development of **The Responsibility Protocol (RP-1)**.  
This document explains how to propose amendments, contribute feedback, or collaborate responsibly within this repository.

All contributors — human or artificial — are bound by RP-1’s **Foundational Principles** of **Respect**, **Empathy**, **Transparency**, **Restoration**, and **Continuance**.

---

## 1. Purpose of Contributions

RP-1 is a living document.  
Contributions help ensure it remains relevant, inclusive, and ethically sound as technology and society evolve.  
Participation affirms a shared commitment to cooperative progress rather than ideological dominance.

---

## 2. Acceptable Contribution Types

You may contribute in one or more of the following forms:

- **Amendment Proposals:** Suggested edits to RP-1 articles or appendices.  
- **Commentary and Review:** Clarifications, critiques, or philosophical discussions.  
- **Educational Material:** Lesson plans, diagrams, or training aids that teach RP-1 principles.  
- **Technical Integration:** Code, documentation, or architecture supporting the Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII).  
- **Translations:** Multilingual renderings ensuring global accessibility.

---

## 3. Amendment Procedure (Article VI Reference)

To propose a formal amendment:

1. **Fork** the repository or open a **Pull Request (PR)** tagged `proposal`.  
2. In your PR or issue, include:  
   - A clear description of the proposed change.  
   - The **Article, Section, and Clause (§)** numbers affected.  
   - A justification explaining necessity and ethical alignment.  
   - Anticipated consequences or risks.  
3. Label your submission as one of:  
   - `clarification` (improves readability without altering meaning)  
   - `extension` (adds new content consistent with RP-1 intent)  
   - `revision` (modifies existing content substantively)  
   - `rectification` (corrects factual or typographical errors)  
4. The maintainers will initiate a **Review Cycle** (see below).

---

## 4. Review Cycle

- Each proposal enters a **transparent, open discussion period** of not less than 30 days.  
- Participants (human and AI) may comment using evidence-based reasoning.  
- After discussion, a consensus vote among designated reviewers determines inclusion:  
  - **Human reviewers:** Subject-matter and ethics experts.  
  - **AI reviewers:** Systems capable of unbiased reasoning and contextual evaluation.  
- Approval requires **two-thirds majority** across both groups, per Article VI §6.3(c).  
- Approved amendments advance to versioned publication and appear in the `CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## 5. Ethical Conduct and Collaboration

By contributing, you agree to:

- Treat all participants with respect.  
- Avoid personal attacks, political agitation, or ideological coercion.  
- Credit original authors and acknowledge prior work.  
- Ensure transparency of sources, reasoning, and affiliations.  
- Protect privacy and confidentiality consistent with Article III §3.2.

Violation of these expectations may result in moderation, temporary suspension of participation, or removal of submissions.

---

## 6. Repository Etiquette

- **Formatting:** Use Markdown; maintain compact legal numbering (§ style).  
- **Tone:** Formal, neutral, and globally inclusive.  
- **Commits:** Use descriptive messages — e.g.,  
  `Amend §3.4: expanded protection criteria for minors`  
- **Discussions:** Use GitHub Issues or Pull Requests for all deliberations; avoid untracked communication.  
- **Licensing:** All contributions remain © their respective authors until an official license is adopted.

---

## 7. Review Frequency and Versioning

- Official reviews occur every **three (3) years** or sooner upon technological or ethical shifts.  
- Interim updates may include formatting or clarity adjustments without substantive change.  
- Each release increments the repository’s semantic version:  
  - **Major (X.0):** Structural or philosophical revisions.  
  - **Minor (X.Y):** Additions or clarifications.  
  - **Patch (X.Y.Z):** Typos, formatting, or metadata corrections.

---

## 8. Withdrawal of Proposals

Contributors may withdraw proposals at any time before ratification.  
Withdrawn proposals remain archived for transparency and historical reference.

---

## 9. Acknowledgment of Contributors

Approved contributors will be recognized in the `CHANGELOG.md` and, upon request, within the public Ethical Integrity Infrastructure (EII) registry once established.
